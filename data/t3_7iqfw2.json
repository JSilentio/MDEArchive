In surprisingly redpoll moments she is confronted with her 30s arriving with no prospects for marriage or children, and then gets knocked up by Ross in a moment of weakness. Really pretty depressing. Joey, our token man slut, wakes up to the reality of her situation and in the process of white knighting her, falls in love, only to be rejected because she ultimately doesn't see him as being a stable long term prospect.\n\nThere are a lot of implicit values in the show that reflect the fact that the 90s was still a more woke era on basic biological imperatives, which would be denied on any modern sitcom.  No current show would portray the sad panic of a woman who realizes she may have missed her window to have a truly loving relationship and provide a complete family for her children.
