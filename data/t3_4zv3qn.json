This dude lays out how Cultures can be understood as organisms that have a structure and lifespan. A Culture is a particular way of viewing/feeling the world that is deeply felt within a certain people, specifically the way that they perceive space. Western culture views space as infinitely expansive and divisible. The ancient Greeks viewed space as a sum of individual bodies. \n\nThis way of perceiving space is deeply felt by the individuals of a culture, and is created out of an understanding and fear of death. All politics, science, math, economics etc. that a Culture creates is in some way an expression of the way it perceive the world. At a certain point a Culture exhausts all it's possibilities and it \"dies\" and becomes a Civilization. This happened to Greek/Classical culture around the time of Alexander the Great, for us Napoleon. In Cultures, you have deep sincere beliefs in things, close genuine interpersonal relationships, strong traditions that ensure everyone has a stable life path. These things break down in Civilization.\n\nIn the same way a person dies, a Culture naturally has to die, and a Civilization is it's carcass. Built on top of the Culture but not felt inwardly in the people anymore. Art stops being a genuine expression by an artist that felt that creating the art was deeply necessary. Civilization's feel no inward fulfillment and so seek to fulfill themselves externally and become expansive, Rome was the Classical Civilization Empire and the United States is the Western one. Right now we are experiencing the first global imperium so far in history, Western Civilization is influencing all parts of the world, most of which do not have the Western infinite space feeling. When this happens its called Psuedomorpohosis, the strong expansive Civilization repressing primitives or young Cultures. This happened when the Roman Republic/Empire territoriality controlled areas in the Middle-East, as young Arabian Culture was developing it was forced to incorporate expressions of Classical into it's own expressions, like using Doric columns in its architecture. But at the base level, it's Arabian and not Classical and the same applies for what's happening now with the West influencing the whole world, and it's only temporary. \n\nA Civilization eventually has to collapse, which usually happens gradually. When a Civilization is completely dissolved you have a dark age sort of period i.e. the \"Middle Ages\" like 400-900 in Europe. Civilization's get more and more divorced from reality as they start to measure things based off models and systems rather than reality. All this transgender and gender stuff we are seeing is an example of a Civilization being divorced from reality, denying biology itself. Notice also that blacks (at least poor ones) as well as Russians are not accepting of gays or trans people. This is because they are members of an early Culture, a different life feeling to the Western one and so are less divorced from intuitively experienced reality. This divorce from reality creates more and more general un-sustainability in all aspects of society until you have the decent into a dark age. During the dark age you have the majority of the population thrust into primitive forms of living, and a regression back to primitive culture which is characterized by a sort of reverent fear and respect for nature, which feels alien and hostile. Eventually, as primitive man understands his mortality, another way of perceiving reality will develop and you cycle repeats itself. At any given time there are multiple Cultures and the remnants of dead Civilizations in various stages, like a bunch of plants of different maturities in a garden. \n\nThe question then is, how close are we to the dark age? Probably like 200-300 years, things will keep getting gradually worse until then. It seems like we are going to see a big shift in the next 10 years though, there will be another financial crisis within the next two years, worse than the GFC so that's really gonna give things a kick. Democracy is in it's last stages and as in ancient Rome, it will be replaced by a form of nationalistic fascism. Then we'll have that for a couple hundred years before total collapse, after which we'll have a sort of global neofeudalism where every serf is competing with every other serf in the world and kept in perpetual unstable poverty, my prediction is that everyone is gonna have an Uber app brain chip but for all work. Go here and shine this dudes shoe's for 17 minutes and get paid $1.12 sort of thing. All we can do is live our lives passionately, seek strong genuine relationships with other people.
