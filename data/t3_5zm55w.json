The FBI investigation of the Anthrax Attacks was the longest and most expensive investigation in the Bureau&amp;#39;s history. The most startling discovery made by FBI agents was thus, the strain of anthrax contained in the letters was a very potent weaponized airborne strain that was created within and existed in only one place on earth: the US Army&amp;#39;s biological weapons research station in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Given this knowledge, it could only be that the attack was perpetrated by those within the lab with special access to the anthrax spores. At first the investigation targeted virologist and physician Steven Hatfill. The FBI was directed to Mr. Hatfill by a fellow biologist, Dr. (((Rosenberg))), who took the opportunity presented by the attacks to campaign around the world against the spread of WMD. The FBI stalked Mr. Hatfill for months, and Attorney General John Ashcroft named him publicly as a suspect, essentially destroying Mr. Hatfill&amp;#39;s long career of public service as well as his reputation. Eventually the FBI investigation, realizing a drought of evidence, moved on from Mr. Hatfill, who sued the US government for defamation and settled to the tune of several million dollars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FBI investigation moved on to Bruce Ivin&amp;#39;s who was similarly stalked by the FBI, his garbage pilfered, and they tried to bribe his hospitalized daughter and then threatened her. The evidence against Ivins was circumstantial at best, non-existent at worst. Eventually, his career ruined, Ivins allegedly committed suicide....by overdosing on Tylenol. For a toxicologist, this is an exceedingly strange way to kill oneself, as the process destroys the liver over the course of days and is an excruciatingly painful and slow way to die. Quite bizarre that someone with access to as well as advanced knowledge of poisons would choose such an inefficient method. With Ivins dead, in 2009 the FBI called the investigation closed, named Ivins as the likely perpetrator, and that was that. Very convenient that the blame should fall upon a dead man who cannot defend himself. On a related note, the former head of the case sued the FBI in 2015, alleging misconduct on the Bureau&amp;#39;s part amounting to the suppression of evidence proving Ivins was innocent.
