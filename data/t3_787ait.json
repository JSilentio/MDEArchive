They housed eight gas chambers and forty-six ovens that could dispose of some 4,400 corpses per day.\" [Author's note: lol that claim alone is incredibly retarded])\n\n   2-2.5 hours to cremate a body (3 Hours is the range given, which includes cool-down time, but let's just say Nazi's had REALLY GOOD GLOVES that could handle HOT HOT 1600 DEGREE ashes https://bostoncremation.org/blog/how-long-to-cremate-a-body)\n\nOkay, so:\n\nLet's pretend that Auschwitz murdered even numbers of people for 365 days for 5 years straight. 365x5 = 1825 days. And, let's also pretend they had 46 ovens up and running, from January 1st, 1940, to December 31st, 1945.\n\n  1,400,000 / 1825 = 767.1 People murdered per day\n\n  767.1 / 46 ovens = 16.7 people per oven in a day\n\nSo, let's take these 16.7 people, and put them in a modern cremation oven:\n\n  16.7 x 2.25 hours it would take to cremate a body = 37.05 Hours per day in order to murder 1.4 million people in a 5 year period, with contemporary ovens.\n\nThe Nazis would have had to squeeze THIRTY SEVEN POINT ZERO FIVE hours out of a 24 hour day in order to completely incinerate victims after gassing them. And this is IF they did it all day, every day, from January 1st, 1940, until December 31st, 1945, without breaks.\n\nOh, and with the use of contemporary cremation ovens. Not those poorly ventilated ones at the camp, that would need to be cleaned after each use.\n\nThis calculation doesn't even factor in how long it would take to transport bodies, crush remains, disposing of them in the rivers. But this is a totally real event that really did happen. Math is anti-semitic.\n\nEDIT: some of you are gay and are saying that fictional, as-of-yet undiscovered \"\"\"mass graves\"\"\" which contain thousands of people is how 1.4 million POWs got killed at auschwitz. This is retarded and here's why:\n\n   24 hours / 2.25 hours to burn a body (still with contemporary oven times) = 10.7 bodies that can be burned in a day in one oven (if cleaning the ovens, waiting for ash cooldown, etc was not a factor).\n\n   10.7 bodies x 46 ovens = 490.7 bodies per day.\n\n   490.7 bodies per day x 1825 days (5 years) = 895,466.7 bodies cremated in total\n\nOkay, are you ready for this part? :\n\n   1,400,000 - 895,466.7 cremated bodies (keep in mind, with MODERN cremation ovens, no cool-down time, no cleaning time, 46 ovens from Jan 1st 1940 to Dec 31st 1945) = 504,533.3 bodies physically not able to be cremated\n\nWith the remaining bodies, you could fill F I V E of Pyongyang's 100,000-seat May Day Stadiums (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungrado_1st_of_May_Stadium\n). Where oh where would the Nazis find such time and good hiding spots to place these corpses where they wouldn't even be discovered 70 years later? After the war was over the fields where Nazis allegedly berried hundreds of thousands were repeatedly plowed and plowed. All international experts were denied entry, denied investigation, denied evidence. It was just we told you - trust us. Typhus deaths were attributed to intentional Nazi murders and BY FAR the biggest cause of death - Allied bombing of supply chains - was attributed as a Nazi crime. The camps that Allies bombed were used as evidence of Nazi  brutality when in reality Allied bombings killed most of the people there. There is (was?) a video on Youtube where a Jewish doctor from one of the camps speaks about this and that is what he said himself. Allies did the killing and then blamed the losers.

But this is a totally real event that really did happen. Math is anti-semitic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: some of you are gay and are saying that fictional, as-of-yet undiscovered &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;mass graves&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; which contain thousands of people is how 1.4 million POWs got killed at auschwitz. This is retarded and here&amp;#39;s why:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24 hours / 2.25 hours to burn a body (still with contemporary oven times) = 10.7 bodies that can be burned in a day in one oven (if cleaning the ovens, waiting for ash cooldown, etc was not a factor).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10.7 bodies x 46 ovens = 490.7 bodies per day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;490.7 bodies per day x 1825 days (5 years) = 895,466.7 bodies cremated in total&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, are you ready for this part? :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1,400,000 - 895,466.7 cremated bodies (keep in mind, with MODERN cremation ovens, no cool-down time, no cleaning time, 46 ovens from Jan 1st 1940 to Dec 31st 1945) = 504,533.3 bodies physically not able to be cremated&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the remaining bodies, you could fill F I V E of Pyongyang&amp;#39;s 100,000-seat May Day Stadiums (&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungrado_1st_of_May_Stadium\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungrado_1st_of_May_Stadium&lt;/a&gt;\n). Where oh where would the Nazis find such time and good hiding spots to place these corpses where they wouldn&amp;#39;t even be discovered 70 years later? After the war was over the fields where Nazis allegedly berried hundreds of thousands were repeatedly plowed and plowed. All international experts were denied entry, denied investigation, denied evidence. It was just we told you - trust us. Typhus deaths were attributed to intentional Nazi murders and BY FAR the biggest cause of death - Allied bombing of supply chains - was attributed as a Nazi crime. The camps that Allies bombed were used as evidence of Nazi  brutality when in reality Allied bombings killed most of the people there. There is (was?) a video on Youtube where a Jewish doctor from one of the camps speaks about this and that is what he said himself. Allies did the killing and then blamed the losers. If you want, and if its not deleted still, i can try to find for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/787ait/this_is_the_wikipedia_article_on_thought_crime/dosc5cu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dosc5cu", "created": 1508820339.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1508791539.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dosbdye", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RaoulDuke96", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dosb2se", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;The official story is that 6,000,000 Jews got killed for absolutely no reason in fantastical gas camps\n\nThe Nazis had plenty of reasons, did you not read Mein Kempf?\n\n&gt;However, evidence points to a different picture\n\nWhat evidence exactly?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The official story is that 6,000,000 Jews got killed for absolutely no reason in fantastical gas camps&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Nazis had plenty of reasons, did you not read Mein Kempf?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, evidence points to a different picture&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What evidence exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/787ait/this_is_the_wikipedia_article_on_thought_crime/dosbdye/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dosbdye", "created": 1508819557.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1508790757.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dosb2se", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ashzel", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 5, "parent_id": "t1_dosawyx", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "The official story is that 6,000,000 Jews got killed for absolutely no reason in fantastical gas camps.
