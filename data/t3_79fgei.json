protein, and peanut protein are not good for you (as protein supplements or any whey at all), whey is the most unhealthy, avoid it as much as possible, pea protein is not great to have alot, and peanut protein is very dehydrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about getting enough protein usually considering how accessible protein is in the modern era, you have to worry about bio diversity (having a diverse diet), and you have to avoid basic carbs like crazy. basic carbs like too much bread or rice or corn or what ever, really basic foods with low nutritive value that are rich in carbohydrates will put bitch tits on you more then edamame will. you need to eat moist fruits and vegables and keep hydrated and eat lots of healthy fats and just work out like a mother fucker if you want to be virile and physically fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the best protein supplement if you really are going to be a faggot about it is bio diversity, but second to that, savi seeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the best way to keep hydrated is to soak chia seeds in water for a while until it gets a gelatinus exterior and then drinking that in a beverage. do this before you excersize or go to work and you will feel less strung out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;soak beans and nuts and seeds in water to prevent them from dehydrating you and aging you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;take martial arts. you will need to work on footwork and dexterity and striking and grappling and pressure points in that order if you need to learn how to fight right now. or if you want to just generally be disciplined and ascend to a higher state of being then you need to focus on footwork and dexterity and pressure points and grappling and striking in that order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what the martial art is, just spar with other people who learn different shit then you and be dedicated to getting good and don&amp;#39;t be closeminded and be so devoted to any one or few martial arts or your own ego and belief that your the shit that you refuse to learn different shit &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;don&amp;#39;t try to avoid failure; instead, embrace it, learn from it and focus on maximizing your chances and profits from success. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;its not the martial art, its the martial artist&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it can be useful to look at what is different between martial arts, but it is even more useful to look at what is the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if you aren&amp;#39;t getting laid, looking at porn and jacking off once a week isn&amp;#39;t going to kill you or even fuck up your life and will in fact actually help you not wind up like elliot rodger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if you are a fucking loser its not because sexual images exist on the internet. just don&amp;#39;t waste all your time looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;like seriously if your the kind of person who uses porn in a negative way where it becomes a problem why wouldn&amp;#39;t you just replace that with something else that you could abuse like wasting your time watching anime or playing video games. its all relative, there are underlying reasons why you would look at too much porn or be negatively affected by it. sexual imagery doesn&amp;#39;t just cast a spell on you that fucking fucks your life up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;at the same time, the affects of looking at porn and jacking off too much are real, but are part of a web of coordinating problems that i am adressing right now that causes bug men in society. fix your diet, your excersize, your values, and the amount of times you jack off and look at porn (not more then once a week). this is the cure to being a bug man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;women are attracted to physical competence and mental competence and dominance. they like confident men who are passionate, who are pursuing some higher path (both a career and a spiritual aim) and are making progress, who are physically stronger then other men and mentally smarter then other men.  women will find you attractive if you have these traits even if you are ugly, the only ugliness that is a deal breaker is if you got facial bones that look like they have caved in and you look like a sewer monster from horrible birth defects or accidents (and i don&amp;#39;t mean merely &amp;quot;really ugly&amp;quot; i mean like you look like an actual irradiated monster), and even then its possible to find a chick who will fuck you because some chicks are into getting fucked by monsters, but generally you will still have to strive to be strong in some way (mentally, physically, spiritually, etc) this is why musicians get laid all the time even though they might be total faggots, because they are still musicians and thats a spiritual and mental skill that they dominate at. fucking stephen hawking has a girl. however, no chick (even though they might appear to feel other wise and say that they want equality) is going to come home after a long day at work to a fat and uneducated man who is a stay at home dad who is spent all day watching netflix and find them super attractive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the biggest turn off to a woman is when you are devastated by them not giving you what you want from them, and the biggest turn on for women is feeling like their sexuality is out of their control and in your control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;learn how to choke girls and slap girls during sex without hurting them or making them call the cops. and don&amp;#39;t get frustrated when you don&amp;#39;t get what you want from a chick because dating is mostly a numbers game beyond fulfilling the prerequisites of being competant. chicks can smell weakness and frustration, they hate when you make whiny noises like prey and whimper or get annoying when they don&amp;#39;t give you what they want. women start to get afraid of getting torture killed in your dungeon when they detect that you are getting angry because they won&amp;#39;t give you what they want, because that means that they have a higher relative value then you do and you desire them more then they desire you, and they are physically inferior so that automatically makes them vulnerable on a carnal level and makes them have a fight/flight/freeze response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a woman will tell other woman you are the best sex they have ever had if you learn shibari because its a very pretty and elegant and drawn out ritualistic way of tying up a woman in a sexual context, and like i&amp;#39;ve said, women fucking love having their sexuality being out of their control. i have never seen a woman in more ecstacy then i have seeing a woman tied up in shibari. women like having their sexuality out of their control because women evolutionarily speaking have their value lowered by their voluntary promiscuity, but psychologically they feel like they can bypass this lowering in value if they feel like on some level they didn&amp;#39;t have a choice but to be sexual. this is the reason why women have rape fantasies (its a way to imagine sexual joy without feeling like you have lowered your value) .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;women generally don&amp;#39;t know what they like until a man helps them figure it out, if a chick says they don&amp;#39;t like anal, it means they have never tried it or a guy did it badly, this applies to anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;get a good water filter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;learn calculus and programming and learn another language, i suggest mandarin or cantonese considering all the asian gentrification going on and also considering asians will probably have to become our ally at some point against israel, (((them))) and

with beliefs you disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;check your self before you wreck your self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;don&amp;#39;t show weakness to someone unless they are one hundred percent your ally and you aren&amp;#39;t currently fighting with them. anyone you are fighting with will use any uncontrolled emotion or weakness against you, even if they are your lover or your best friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but don&amp;#39;t lie to your self and pretend something doesn&amp;#39;t bother you or isn&amp;#39;t a weakness when it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if you do drugs, don&amp;#39;t do them very often, maybe like once or twice a month tops, try and go even longer if you can. the unrest from sobriety is what motivates ambition and spurns people to try great things,
