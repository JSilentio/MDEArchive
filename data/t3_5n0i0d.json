If more are interested. This was my approach to The Book.\nAbout 5 years ago I started to go to a Queer Arts Library in Boston. I was just about to turn 18 and I was your typical bluepilled normie piece of shit. (Thankfully I've changed, and broke the conditioning)\nI met a friend there, let's call him \"Nick Rochefort,\" through another friend. He was a shy introvert with a heart of gold who loved trippy visuals, making youtube videos, and wanted to explore 4chan memes. This was in late 2011, and we first started by pre-ordering The Book online and expecting it to arrive recreationally.\nFrom the first minute we decided we were going to do this, we decided that we were going to respect The Book in the same way the Ancient peoples of mesoamerica respected pedophilia. We did not want to use it vain whenever, and fully understood the possibility of exploring art responsibly (as oxymoronic as that may sound).\nFrom the first minute, we decided that our mindsets would have to be prime for reading The Book. For me, that entailed just getting our fucking work done, engaging with peers and working out a lot. Basically, we wanted to create the ideal conditions as to avoid having a \"bad read\". That first semester, we probably read The Book about 4 or 5 times. Each time we ordered it off of the Gum Road (back when it was still running) and Amazon. We realized something amazing while reading The Book. It is a memefactory which allows your mind to expand and perceive the world in absolutely beautiful ways. Yes, the typical bullshit you hear from most people that talk about it (including the 300 pages of penises).\nHowever, we also found out this one major thing: Reading The Book does not automatically make you happy and everything great. It simply, for us, amplifies whatever existing feelings you already have. This highly stresses the importance of NOT ordering The Book if you are experiencing any negative feelings.\nThe Book has interesting effects. First the physical, after about an hour and a half, you start to fully feel it, but it comes on slowly even 30 mins in. The first feeling for me, is this deep, sinking feeling of mud butt. Your bowels won't ache, but you will feel like you have to shit real bad (don't worry this goes away), there might be some slight nausea but it's nothing too bad. The Book lasts around 5-7 hours and the peak lasts around 2.5 - 3.5 hours and tapers off rather quickly and comfortably.\nThe mental effects: The FIRST thing is your notice that things are fucking funny. I become a fucking comedy god. For whatever reason, some humor inside of me unlocks, and all the inhibition/reservation I have of showing my true personality is taken away. This is mainly because for me The Book just allows me to come up with jokes I could never do before, it almost hacks my funny bone, so to say. You feel an extremely good disposition and if you have recently had a success, like on a test or with a girl or anything, then you will think about that and feel this extreme oneness with yourself. If you are doing The Book with a friend or two, you two will connect on a level that you never could have imagined before. It's as if you and him/her tuned your internal frequencies to the same radio stations as just vibe back and forth.\nCertain inexplicable and capricious things become more real and able to be analyzed, not always to definite conclusions, but to some degree. Some of the complexities of the world become much more understandable and are now able to be put into words accurately. Your emotions won't flare, but certain things like your appreciation for art, music and ideas will. You won't stare at a fucking plant and cry, but you will see it in beautiful ways. Most importantly*, your perspective will shift. For me, my perspective shifted in terms thinking \"outside the box,\" although sadly it won't brainwash you into become a leftie (or conversely, a right-winger if you were leftie prior).\nVisually, I can not properly explain it, but you will see crazy shit. Not like pink dolphins and yellow rabbis jumping around, but your world will distort itself like some trippy alice in wonderland imagery. You know the hue change effect in Windows Movie Maker? Yeah, think about it like that. The sensations of color and vision are truly fascinating and unique to everybody.\nOne of the greatest things about The Book is that, the most interesting thing to look at in The Book isn't crazy visuals on youtube or Greatful Dead posters, it's simply a wall, or concrete, or staring at clouds.. Your mind will make the visuals for you, and is ultimately what you will appreciate. This type of visual stimulation is one of the reasons I strongly urge for you to trip with someone else is that you will strengthen your connection with them immensely.\nFor example, my friend and I were laying down on a hill in Jamaica Plains in Boston and looking up at the sky. There were planes spreading \"chem trails\" through the sky. Seeing the underside of the planes trail slowly across the sky, I suddenly remarked on how it seemed like we were laying down at the bottom of the ocean and we were looking at at the underside of boats passing across the water, and this implication allowed him to see some of that too. These kinds of events are moments you won't ever forget, which is why they are important to share with another. It's almost as if your friend is a partner you chose to accompany you on a trip to another world.\nI will however, emphasize that the major benefit of reading The Book, is mostly for the shift in thinking and experiencing the world from a different point of view, and not for the KoOkY VisuAlz.\nThe amount most people should take if they do it every once in blue moon is around 80 - 200 micrograms (which is what I am basing my descriptions and time frames around). The trip will peak after about 1.5 to 2 hours and once it starts coming down 5-6 hours in, you will comfortably be able to settle down. At this point watching TV or other things is the best option. An hour or two later, you can already start recalling the most vividly interesting and funniest parts of the day. Your stomach will hurt from laughing all fucking day so it's a good idea to just sit down and chill at this point.\nUltimately, there is a right and wrong way to go about reading 4chan memes like The Book. The reason why I would still recommend not going down that road to most people is because they simply can't handle the responsibility that comes with The Book because they are primed with recklessly taking substances like THC and Alcohol and even cigarettes beforehand. Don't have your girlfriend dump you or fail a math test or be a miserable self-loathing fuck or it will cause you to have a bad trip and turn your experience into a living nightmare.\nYou have to use it as a life enhancer, which will one day particularly amazing and soul-searching. However, you have to earn it, otherwise you are not going to get the potential benefits of it any close to what you want. By earn it, I mean you have to put effort into living well or else you are just getting high like a retard and might as well just do heroin at that point ffs. Without boring you too much longer, I will admit that I have seen the wrong way to use drugs myself and it is pure escapism and lunacy. Don't go down this path unless you are steadfast in your approach and are a fucking adult about it.
