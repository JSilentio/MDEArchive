The only people at church who didn&amp;#39;t seem to be disgusted by my boners were the gracious priests - a very non judgmental and kind bunch.

The first girl to say hi to me was Cindy, my crush, and I could feel the pressure building in my groinus. Everything looked OK from the outside but I could feel the pressure rising and I quickly went to he bathroom. I could see purple veins nearly bursting, spreading from underneath the tape and traveling all the way up to my belly button; the pain was immense. I screamed as I ripped off the tape, and with it came my good pubic hairs - the ones that were dark brown and not clear like fishing wire. I left the bloody tape on the bathroom door and went through the rest of my day with a bloody boner. Saying I was pissed off would have been an understatement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next week, after healing, I tried a more advanced and gross technique - I stretch-plugged my dick into my asshole, something I&amp;#39;ve been able to do since forever.

But I wore tight fitting shirts and the had of my penis could be seen as it pressed against my belly. One day Cindy came over and said &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s that?&amp;quot; touched it, and I came all over myself.

This sort of bent my dick in a downward position but it worked quite well, that is, until the cap came off the sharpie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in math class and I started to feel a burning sensation in my bowels, which was pretty normal for me.
