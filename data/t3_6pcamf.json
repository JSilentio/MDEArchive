In history, we see this in the Revolutionary War, of the group of lowly pilgrims and settlers fighting back against the oppressive force of one of the greatest empires in all of Western history, the British Empire. We see this theme in our media and pop culture. In books, we see it in Harry Potter fighting against the Voldemort\u2019s army. In movies we see this quite plainly in the story of Star Wars, a rag tag gang of rebels taking on the Empire. In games even we see this narrative in the likes of Final Fantasy VII, with Cloud, Barret, Tifa and the rest fighting back against the oppressive Shinra Corporation.\n\nOur generation has been raised with this narrative, ingrained in our psyche and through exposure to it in hundreds of variations, but always the same at it\u2019s core. It is a powerful narrative after all. But the rebellion we see today is not the same as the rebellion of the past. It is a type of rebellion that is much more insidious, more dangerous. It is **Manufactured Rebellion** .\n\nIn the old stories, the thing that gives the rebel narrative it\u2019s power is the grassroots nature of it. Rebellion was a small, bottom up movement, often depicted as much weaker than the entity being rebelled against. For instance, the Rebel Army in Star Wars is a group of misfits, a young man who works for his uncle in the middle of nowhere, a lovable criminal, a giant teddy bear that makes strange noises and a couple of androids for comedic relief. Against all odds, they take down an entire massive, oppressive empire and free the galaxy from their rule. If you look at these classic stories, you will always see the theme of the ragtag bunch, the counterculture, the misfits, the true grassroots movement fighting against the authority. Manufactured Rebellion, however, is a different beast altogether. Manufactured Rebellion is very much top down. It is not a rebellion in the traditional sense, but more of an acting out of what a rebellion might look like, like actors on a theater stage. \n\t\n*\u201cI sat and smoked my cigar until I lapsed into thought. \u201cYou are going on,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cto become an old man, without being anything and without really undertaking to do anything.

And what are you doing?\u201d . . . [S]uddenly this thought flashed through my mind: \u201cYou must do something, but inasmuch as with your limited capacities it will be impossible to make anything easier than it has become, you must undertake to make something harder.\u201d This notion pleased me immensely. . . . I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.\u201d  - Soren Kierkegaard*\n \nWith the coming of modernity came unprecedented ease and comfort in nearly every area of life. Not only physically, but spiritually and mentally, we are in an age of unprecedented safety. With ease and comfort seeping into everything in life, we even attempt to make struggle itself an easy task. Rebellion is by it\u2019s nature a struggle, because one must move against the flow of the times, against the projection of society, out of the sheer will to create something better. This is no simple task, and requires becoming a real, authentic individual with true purpose. The task of becoming a mythic hero in the vein of Frodo or Bilbo Baggins is no easy task, and so we make Role Playing Games that give the illusion of the heroic journey, so too have we begun to manufacture Rebellion, creating a farce or a simulation that mocks the original, but with none of the danger of becoming a real human being.\nWe can see this today everywhere we look. Corporations, governments, talk show hosts, and other entities will manufacture a set of safe boundaries in which people can play the rebellious hero, they set up the stage and we are the actors. They tell us to fight against the oppressive force of Donald Trump, or racism, or transphobia, or climate change, or whatever the current villain of the week is, and we pretend as if we are making a change in the world. We take part as the rebellious hero and think we have done something, all the while staying safely in our pens, safely under the thumb of those that wish to destroy us. We do not want to be bothered with the task of becoming a true Self, a real person, and so we are content with remaining cattle.\n\nThis is the rebellion of today.
