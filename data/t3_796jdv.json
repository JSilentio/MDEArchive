Programming can be fun, I am not acting like I am some expert here, I know a little basic scripting that could be learned in a couple of weeks or a couple of months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Programming humor sucking, well that&amp;#39;s the corner we painted ourselves into when we had computers do everything so we&amp;#39;re out of a job. Now everything will be awesome and we will be able to afford none of it, so we will invite the government to come help us. The capitalistic thing to do would be to learn the crap unfortunately.
