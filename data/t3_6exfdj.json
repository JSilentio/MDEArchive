But even with the Paris plan, they would not be able to keep the temperature rise under 2 degrees so I believe they should focus on living when large parts of the world are deserts. Even Spain now is beginning desertification which will destroy wine production and so on so people need to learn how to rely on indoor agriculture and so on instead and build out the infrastructure. Because no matter what side everyone takes nobody can deny that climate changes are happening right now. In less than 5 years the north pole will be completely ice free during the summer, they already started shipping routes over there which is at least 800 000 years since last time it was possible. And these changes have never happened so fast before in Earth history (by far... changes are done in 300 years what usually takes one hundred thousand years), that everyone can agree on. That is just plain data we can see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People disagree on the interpretation of why and politicians will never do anything near enough to stop it because it cost money so it is better that the money is used to learn how to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6exfdj/how_will_glumphfh_ever_recover/dieighu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dieighu", "created": 1496519076.0, "author_flair_text": "goy", "created_utc": 1496490276.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "diea5jq", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thatpolefromlowell", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 5, "parent_id": "t1_didzrnf", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "If everyones setting their own goals anyway why sign an accord at all?
