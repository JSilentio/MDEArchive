The danger that comes from identification comes not from accepting it, but from confusing the inauthentic dasein with the authentic dasein (your true state of being). I went down the path of rejecting my inauthentic dasein and it led only to remaining completely separated from the world around me, disconnected from my own presence in the world. It is good to know that your presence in the world includes a particular race with its particular traits, a particular appearance, particular class within your society, etc. Just maintain the knowledge that these facts are only a part of your inauthentic presence, and that the true self (soul, essence, etc.) transcends its mere material presence&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/7b93h7/tinder/dpgo3fv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dpgo3fv", "created": 1510062109.0, "author_flair_text": "BIG DUMB MAN", "created_utc": 1510033309.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7b93h7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7b93h7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7b93h7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7b93h7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7b93h7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_dpgrqbx", "depth": 10, "children": []}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dpgrqbx", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "beefking", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t1_dpgo432", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Are you me?
