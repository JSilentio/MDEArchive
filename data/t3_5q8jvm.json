I believe that this video was made to make you experience the feeling of \"clapter\" (portmanteau of clap + laughter), which is characterized by a strong feeling of agreement with an idea. Clapter is not laughter. Clapter is the kind of response that people such as Bill Maher, Jon Oliver, and Steven Crowder aim for. I believe that people such as Maher and Crowder are not actually even trying to be funny. Based on your responses (the responses of people who claim to have enjoyed/appreciated the \"jews rock\" sketch), in which you have failed time and time again to identify even a single moment in the video that induced laughter, instead opting to express a general sense of agreement with a point that the video was making, I believe that you did not experience laughter, and that you instead experienced clapter. I also believe that MDE was only trying to induce clapter, and not laughter, in the audience. I have a hunch that a lot of the parts of world peace that I didn't find funny were just going for \"clapter\" which is a huge fucking disappointment to me. What's especially shitty is that clapter plays a pretty big roll in the \"internet echo chamber\" phenomenon. See: Maher, Oliver, SNL on the left vs Crowder, McInnes, MDE on the right. I mean just read your fucking post. Read it. It's sentence after sentence of regurgitated strawman-creating, clapter-seeking, edgy youtube rant.

I believe that people such as Maher and Crowder are not actually even trying to be funny. Based on your responses (the responses of people who claim to have enjoyed/appreciated the &amp;quot;jews rock&amp;quot; sketch), in which you have failed time and time again to identify even a single moment in the video that induced laughter, instead opting to express a general sense of agreement with a point that the video was making, I believe that you did not experience laughter, and that you instead experienced clapter. I also believe that MDE was only trying to induce clapter, and not laughter, in the audience. I have a hunch that a lot of the parts of world peace that I didn&amp;#39;t find funny were just going for &amp;quot;clapter&amp;quot; which is a huge fucking disappointment to me. What&amp;#39;s especially shitty is that clapter plays a pretty big roll in the &amp;quot;internet echo chamber&amp;quot; phenomenon. See: Maher, Oliver, SNL on the left vs Crowder, McInnes, MDE on the right. I mean just read your fucking post. Read it. It&amp;#39;s sentence after sentence of regurgitated strawman-creating, clapter-seeking, edgy youtube rant. Are you even thinking or are you just letting MDE think for you? Did you formulate those opinions on your own or did MDE tell them to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5q8jvm/can_someone_explain_to_me_the_jews_rock_video/dd4xvlt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dd4xvlt", "created": 1485879923.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1485851123.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dd2coqq", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PsychicMice", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dd17tjk", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "The difference between a point and a joke is the delivery and punchline.

Comedy cannot reach everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example: For me, it&amp;#39;s not only funny because of the inherent statement, but the audacity of Sam&amp;#39;s persona putting such a sketch on national television. It makes me giggle that he was given the power to do that, because I understand irony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I would say if you were a troll, you would continue arguing like a whiny bitch, but if you were a normal dude then you would admit that comedy is subjective and this sketch is simply not for you, which is A-OK.
