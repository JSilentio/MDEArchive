After separating the T from the LBG movement, Transpeople began holding \"power\" parades to counter the 'faggy' pride parades that the LBG movement had embraced. It became understood that transsexualism was not related to orientation, and trans people slowly distanced themselves from the gays, lesbians, and bisexuals who had already been so fully accepted into society. Within the trans movement, one recurring theme appeared: strength. Gays and lesbians sought acceptance and social status through the arts. They were over the top, foppish, flamboyant. Transpeople were something else. The burgeoning movement soon found that most of its influential leaders were athletes. Janae Kroc, Caitlyn Jenner, Fallon Fox, and Mack Beggs all became icons of strength in the Trans world, and following these examples, in culture at large.\n\nUnder president Michelle Obama, Trans people were allowed to join the military again, which allowed the Army and Marines to activate an estimated 15,000 trans soldiers and marines. Every division in the service soon found Trans people climbing to leadership positions through a combination of mental acumen and physical superiority. Inevitably, military leaders were forced to acknowledge that they had been wrong. Allowing gays to enlist had been a huge error, as they added only weakness to the service. Trans people had highlighted their ineptitude with startling displays of strength that continually humiliated LGB troops until Obama enacted an amendment to the GI bill offering to pay these LGB soldiers, sailors, marines, and air(wo)men to leave the service and go to college.(college was already free, they had to be paid). Gays soon began taking their rightful place as leaders in the realm of entertainment. Mattis commits suicide out of shame, revealing he was gay all along.\n\nThese changes were all in good fortune too, as the United Peaceful Caliphate, the US's chief ally in the middle east (aside from Israel), soon found itself under attack by Non-Communist Russia(NCR), and the Chinese Heads of Industry Alliance(CHIA), a heavily capitalistic government. As these forces began gunning down innocent, peace loving Muslims of all racial makeups, taking the natural resources of the nations(just oil, and poppy fields, really), and breaking the rule of sharia law wherever they conquered, President Obama knew she had to act. Sending in military units to directly confront the US's Nuclear armed enemies was out of the question, however, as it would risk total annihilation. Refusing to sit back and let the world be a victim, she Assembled the entirety of the Trans members of the armed forces on the white house lawn, President Michelle asked for volunteers. Every Trans member, in unison, took one step forward, in a giant 15,000 person thunderous step.\n\nIn the years that followed, these trans heroes infiltrated the communities under assault by the NCR/CHIA forces. Using special training as community organizers, and their unique genderqueer/genderfluid capabilities to defy capture by changing appearance, the transforces were able to integrate into and unite a ragtag group of diverse rebels against an evil, monolithic empire. Eventually, like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the NCR/CHIA forces were broken and dispersed, some even choosing to switch sides and serve alongside their valiant, trans-lead former foes. \n\nThe bravery and steroid induced strength of these trans folks may one day avert nuclear war and ensure the continued freedom and liberty of the Islamic world.
