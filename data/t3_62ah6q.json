Really just the idea of a goofy ass bloodlusting clown living in the sewer system is scary, but it&amp;#39;s sad to see in the recent new IT movie trailer that the whole idea behind it is now going to be completely convoluted. Pennywise wasn&amp;#39;t scary because he ran really fast and shook his head until it was blurred and screamed, he was scary because he was equal parts goofy and murderous, character traits that can&amp;#39;t be reconciled with one another - making it surreal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give another idea of surrealism being the scariest thing in any horror movie, look at The Shining. The scene where the two girls are down the hall, and they&amp;#39;re saying, in unison, &amp;quot;come play with us Danny, forever and ever&amp;quot;. The girls shouldn&amp;#39;t be there, they are out of place, they both look similar, they&amp;#39;re wearing the same clothes, clothes that are out of period. They are little girls but the voices that call out are oddly woman-like. There are things that don&amp;#39;t fit together and that makes the scene eery, it plays on the fact that our brain tries to make sense of things, and when it can&amp;#39;t, we feel odd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have almost an entire generation of people who think about that scene when they&amp;#39;re in hotel hallways, lol. That means it had a lasting effect on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, anyone who&amp;#39;s lived with an abusive parent or guardian knows how scarily realistic The Shining is when concerning how some people can be when they get angry or drunk - they become completely different people, and their eyes look different. When it&amp;#39;s a parent or someone you&amp;#39;ve known for a long time, it&amp;#39;s even worse. I think the shining captures that perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example is Signs, one of my favorite alien movies. Though it&amp;#39;s pretty goofy looking back on it now, it really did have some very surreal scenes. Like this one: &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/aO7yO24g-Xs?t=14s\"&gt;https://youtu.be/aO7yO24g-Xs?t=14s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a monster outside of my room. Can I have a glass of water?&amp;quot; - The two pieces of this simple line of dialogue make sense, but they don&amp;#39;t fit together. How calmly the little girl delivers this line is eery as well, and the rest of the scene is too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mel Gibson thinks the &amp;quot;monster&amp;quot; that the girl was talking about is a human, specifically the people they think have been leaving crop circles in their corn field. When they chase after this person and realize it couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be a human, because it vertically jumps onto their roof, that&amp;#39;s another case of surrealism. It breaks our expectation of how reality should perform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the new IT trailer I can see that they&amp;#39;re going to turn pennywise into a gritty looking monster that is always hiding just around the corner, that will jump out and scare the main characters. Pennywise should be bright and colorful, he should be bubbly and fun, but murderous at the same time. The movie won&amp;#39;t work, it won&amp;#39;t be scary, it won&amp;#39;t have any lasting effect on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Retards think what makes a movie scary is how &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; it is. That isn&amp;#39;t fucking true. What makes a scary movie scary is how normal it looks from the outside. Signs LOOKS like a normal alien movie.
