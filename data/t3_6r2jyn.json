However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!\nThe problem is that the statement \"I should get my fair share\" had an implicit \"too\" at the end: \"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.\" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant \"only I should get my fair share\", which clearly was not your intention.

That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are white) can identify with. So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered \"news\", while a middle-aged white woman being killed is treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don't treat all lives as though they matter equally.\nJust like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase \"black lives matter\" also has an implicit \"too\" at the end: it's saying that black lives should also matter.

I think Jordan Peterson (I know that name gets old on this sub after a while) is right when he describes biblical stories as these story archs that were crafted over time by telling these stories again and again (the bible was only really standardized after Constantine converted 300 years after Jesus's death). These stories I think, are intended to teach against mankind's inclinations. \n\n\nAn example: the parable of the prodigal son- the loser son of a father asks for his inheritance as an advance and wastes all of it within his lifetime on extravagance. He comes home to beg for his father's forgiveness and to work as his servant, expecting to be cast off by his father. The son feels shame not only for his greed/hedonism, but also because asking his father for his share of the inheritance were to wish he were dead and value the monetary aspect to familial relations rather than dutiful love. Instead the father welcomes him back and celebrates his return. While the older son relents at this forgiveness, the father reminds him that he is to inherit everything. The story of a son returning to a \"loving father\" with a feeling of immense shame/guilt over their sin (in this case rooted in greed/materialism/ignorance of the value of the family) parallels the Christian idea that we can all repent to God (father-Almighty father parallel) for our shortsightedness/sin. \n\n\nAgain I'm not trying to proselytize on this sub, I know religious talk makes some feel uncomfortable. The bible is latent with meaning not because it is a control mechanism or it is the manifestation of a pre-scientific people trying to explain the circumstances of being. The bible is latent with meaning rather to protect society from the inclinations of the human condition. In the above story the self-interested actions of the son are met with demise and he ultimately learns that what matters most is his family. On the other side, the father's forgiveness shows that a family unit must be strong enough to overcome the quibbles of those within it. Numerous stories like that serve an active purpose to expose the human condition, instill this idea that with genuine remorse for our actions can be met with unconditional forgiveness by real Christians or at the very least God himself. \n\n\nIf you would imagine the most family-centric, most studying of the bible (New/Old Testament), the Mormons would come to mind (although most don't fully consider them christian). Utahans/Mormons rank at the top 5 in statistics that indicate standard of living in America (lowest divorce rate, highest income, high education attainment, lowest GINI coefficient, lowest income inequality, ONLY native-born Americans with a birth rate well above 2.1, etc.) Although I personally am not Mormon (papist by birth) and not too keen on the weirder aspects of their faith, I can respect that their community is so strong and successfully implements the role faith ought to play in familial life-which the statistics only corroborate. \n\nAm I saying go move out to Salt Lake City and snag a qt WASPy Mormon gal?
