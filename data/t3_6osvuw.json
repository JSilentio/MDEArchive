For the sake of brevity I'll skip the events that led to the fall and just cut to when Yeltsin, Russia's first president took power. \n\nWhen Yeltsin took power, all of the Russians in government had been sold on a western idea of a fast transition from a planned economy to a market economy in a system called \"shock therapy\"- an idea pushed by famous western economist Jeffery Sachs. The idea holds that in order to transition the government needs to liquidate all its assets immediately and privatize the economy. While this occurs their aim should be to stabilize prices and make sure pension plans can be paid out to the elderly (as state coffers are bled dry from lack of funds). This system \"worked\" in Poland as growth rates rose and prices stabilized, but the program was largely ill conceived and the only reason Poland made it out ok was partially because the Germany was the world's 4th largest economy and had a large interest in integrating Poland into the eu as fast as possible. \n\nWhat shock therapy did to Russia was a economic catastrophe that world had never seen before. Those who bought up government industries quickly consolidated into a small group of wealthy Russians (what we call today oligarchs) and weren't contributing to the economy but rather bleeding the country dry and using the state as its patsy in a process known as \"asset stripping\". In this process, the oligarchs buy up industries but strip it down selling it piece by piece, thus taking advantage of market forces to make a quick buck and not investing in the industries they owned so as to increase their market share. The Russian state needed to take out numerous loans to cushion the blow of the oligarch's extortion, again and again causing ruin to the country. \n\nThe economic collapse in Russia was devastating to the common man. During the oligarchs' free reign, Russian GDP fell 50% over the course of 10 years. For context, American GDP fell 25% over the course of 5 years in the Great Depression. Their economic crisis was literally twice as bad as our depression and theirs only really recovered a decade ago. Prostitution and organized crime was now everywhere in the life of the average Russian. If you'd like to see a film that shows the kind of alienation the average Russian felt to the cruelty of the oligarchs, the rise of organized crime, and the general poverty of the era bred watch the movie Brat and brat 2(Russian title for \"brother\"). \n\nNot every western economist thought \"shock therapy\" was a good idea. Joseph Stieglitz wrote early on that Sachs and others' plan was destined to fail and bailouts were never going to help Russia stabilize. Whether we westerners knew that this was bound to fail or not is irrelevant, however we did take advantage of Russia's relative instability in Europe politically. The US was making signs that NATO would not expand, however Clinton swiftly used NATO to break up Russian aligned Yugoslavia and bush brought in the Baltic countries-thus bringing US troops only a few hundred miles from St. Petersburg.\n\nThe oligarchs used their clout to buy Yeltsin, they essentially gave him an offer he couldn't refuse. They said either we fund your campaign for reelection and you give into our demands or we fund your rival. Yeltsin accepted and was reelected to the presidency. At the time the war in Chechnya had just erupted and was going badly as the Russian army was disorganized after the fall and Yeltsin himself couldn't handle the enormous weight of saving his country (he was an alcoholic and would show up to press conferences drunk- Look up videos of it on YouTube). Yeltsin asked Putin to take his place as he intended to step down.

For the sake of brevity I&amp;#39;ll skip the events that led to the fall and just cut to when Yeltsin, Russia&amp;#39;s first president took power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Yeltsin took power, all of the Russians in government had been sold on a western idea of a fast transition from a planned economy to a market economy in a system called &amp;quot;shock therapy&amp;quot;- an idea pushed by famous western economist Jeffery Sachs. The idea holds that in order to transition the government needs to liquidate all its assets immediately and privatize the economy. While this occurs their aim should be to stabilize prices and make sure pension plans can be paid out to the elderly (as state coffers are bled dry from lack of funds). This system &amp;quot;worked&amp;quot; in Poland as growth rates rose and prices stabilized, but the program was largely ill conceived and the only reason Poland made it out ok was partially because the Germany was the world&amp;#39;s 4th largest economy and had a large interest in integrating Poland into the eu as fast as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What shock therapy did to Russia was a economic catastrophe that world had never seen before. Those who bought up government industries quickly consolidated into a small group of wealthy Russians (what we call today oligarchs) and weren&amp;#39;t contributing to the economy but rather bleeding the country dry and using the state as its patsy in a process known as &amp;quot;asset stripping&amp;quot;. In this process, the oligarchs buy up industries but strip it down selling it piece by piece, thus taking advantage of market forces to make a quick buck and not investing in the industries they owned so as to increase their market share. The Russian state needed to take out numerous loans to cushion the blow of the oligarch&amp;#39;s extortion, again and again causing ruin to the country. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The economic collapse in Russia was devastating to the common man. During the oligarchs&amp;#39; free reign, Russian GDP fell 50% over the course of 10 years. For context, American GDP fell 25% over the course of 5 years in the Great Depression. Their economic crisis was literally twice as bad as our depression and theirs only really recovered a decade ago. Prostitution and organized crime was now everywhere in the life of the average Russian. If you&amp;#39;d like to see a film that shows the kind of alienation the average Russian felt to the cruelty of the oligarchs, the rise of organized crime, and the general poverty of the era bred watch the movie Brat and brat 2(Russian title for &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not every western economist thought &amp;quot;shock therapy&amp;quot; was a good idea. Joseph Stieglitz wrote early on that Sachs and others&amp;#39; plan was destined to fail and bailouts were never going to help Russia stabilize. Whether we westerners knew that this was bound to fail or not is irrelevant, however we did take advantage of Russia&amp;#39;s relative instability in Europe politically. The US was making signs that NATO would not expand, however Clinton swiftly used NATO to break up Russian aligned Yugoslavia and bush brought in the Baltic countries-thus bringing US troops only a few hundred miles from St. Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The oligarchs used their clout to buy Yeltsin, they essentially gave him an offer he couldn&amp;#39;t refuse. They said either we fund your campaign for reelection and you give into our demands or we fund your rival. Yeltsin accepted and was reelected to the presidency.
