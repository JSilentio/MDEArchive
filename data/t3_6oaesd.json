Your character is part of the Culters and is sent on missions that frequently have the purpose of setting the Jians up as evil. At the same time, your mentor is off on his own tangent, trying to unite the Culters and Jians against the ruling Federation.

You get a variety of starting weapons, such as SMGs, assault rifles, sniper rifles, etc. You also have various powers such as creating clones of yourself, turning weapons and ammo into health, making people explode into monsters, etc., that consume regenerating energy. You also have the ability to hack into almost anything, such as turrets, and even your human enemies to turn them into allies, control them like a puppet, etc. With each kill, you gain experience and money or &amp;quot;brouzoufs&amp;quot; that can be used to purchase new weapons, powers,  upgrade your cybernetic enhancements, and also research certain objects enemies drop to unlock more weapons, powers, and stat bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Character and enemy design take various clear influences, such as Warhammer 40k, Alien, etc. Environments are mostly cyberpunk cities/ industrial areas, save for a few maps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because all the spoken dialogue is in a fictional language, written dialogue is required for interaction. The dialogue in the game is somewhat poor due to a combination of bad translation and lukewarm writing, such as your character changing tone mid conversation from collected, to as informal as many other characters you meet (looters and such.)
