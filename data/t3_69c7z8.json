Most people seem to think he&amp;#39;s a maniac or a psychopath, screwed up in the head, and in official interviews I&amp;#39;ve read from Martin Scorsese he&amp;#39;s stated that Taxi Driver is a feminist film, and it&amp;#39;s a character study of Travis&amp;#39; warped masculinity and frustration with women, as well as his loneliness and warped psyche.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is though, even despite all that, I found Travis to be one of the most relatable characters I&amp;#39;ve seen in a movie in a long time. Some of the stuff he said really resonated with me.
