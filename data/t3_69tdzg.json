I really don't believe any one person has the capability to enact utopian changes in society regardless of their capital or status. It's not enough just to change the material conditions of society, such as redistributing wealth or building infrastructure or whatever, but they have to enact psychological and conditional changes in the people themselves, and no capital can accomplish that. Of course being able to change the material conditions is a good start, and people like Bill Gates (who I understand has his own share of profit-oriented issues) who contribute their capital into things like improving medicine and infrastructure are definitely contributing to  an improved society, but its not enough if the people are still conditioned for self-destruction. \n\nA real not-so-degenerate society can only be created by the people (low/middle class, proletariat, etc.) individually becoming productive, generative, and creative in enacting change on small local levels - the collective efforts of which, with improved material conditions, could create permanent change.
