Aside from some of the offline games I play on my Switch and DS, I play some online games as well. Overwatch, Rocket League, PUBG, LoL, Dota2, Hearthstone, CoD, Destiny 2, CS:GO, Smash bros, those are my top 10. Now, I play on XboxOne, PS4, as well as PC. On top of the purchase price of these games some of these games also have other costs within the game to unlock achievements and aesthetic customizations. Like I said I'm not really a gamer, I have a job so I can't exactly spend as much time as say a middle schooler on Christmas break unlocking some of the features of these games, so occasionally I have to spend money in game. Don't even get me started on loot crates. I also have to pay monthly fee to access online for XboxOne and PS4. So you know, if net neutrality goes away and ISP's are able to charge me more for internet or implement data caps it's going to seriously affect my life and I'm already struggling to make ends meet as it is.  \n\nI also have a pretty healthy libido and like everyone watch streaming porn pretty much everyday. Again, if ISP's implement data caps or have the ability to charge porn sites more and those sites decide to stop streaming free pornography I'd likely have to get a second job just to pay for monthly access to a variety of sites and that's assuming they don't increase their membership fees.\n\nNow having said all that, I also use social media sites like reddit, twitter and facebook to take part in online activism and honestly if I have to start budgeting my data I'm afraid my voice would be silenced as I literally wouldn't be able to afford to speak out about social justice issues and counter online hate groups and society would be worse off.\n\nAnyway, that's just a little about me.
