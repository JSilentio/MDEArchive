feel alive...didnt jack off since march and only woke up 2 times to find myself ejacing...sex drive is dead. but i guess it always was, at least i uncucked myself and dont masturbate to strangers having sex...but i cant really fantasize because it seems so far away and so unlikely, i never had sexual thoughts in public, i fall in love with girls' faces/lips/cute noses though...was never attracted to boobs because my sister is a prostitute and i grew up with her and my mom and i never thought anything sexual around them...also she used to fart in my face to get a reaction out of me when I was 4-6 so thats probably why im more attracted to female assholes than anything else...fuck i wish i had a daughter i could protect from becoming a thot without growing up to be a dyke",
