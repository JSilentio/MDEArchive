The desire to displace their own desire onto others. The desire for others to desire them. The desire for society to control this trembling and traumatic force of desire. All these various desires are aided by this fantasy of a simple relation of being the object of man, his look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it not fascinating and revealing that the sources of the sense of being watched are in materials that the young women seek out: their gossip magazines, in drama TV shows, in chick lit. &lt;em&gt;Why do they not avoid it?&lt;/em&gt; This is, of course, rank hypocrisy.

We don\u2019t ever really encounter each other during sex because there\u2019s so much regulating the interaction, particularly our ideas of sex/gender/man/woman. By the time we get to the bedroom, it\u2019s already too late to meet another human being. \u201cOne can no more speak of \u2018woman\u2019 than of \u2018man\u2019 without \u2026invalidating in advance any conceptualization,\u201d declared French feminist writer Helene Cixous.

Objectification is not the same as dehumanization. Indeed, for Lacan, it is an intrinsic part of the sexual process. The question that needs to be answered isn\u2019t \u201cHow do we not objectify?\u201d but \u201cWhy would I want to do anything else?\u201d Desire will lead you to releasing all the false objects of desire that you think will please you.

Somehow that R became an A.  The question is, why bother?  Why not either make grades rigorous and valid so we know exactly what they mean, or else do away with them entirely?  Because in either case society and your head would implode from the existential vacuum.  Instead, everyone has to get As AND the As have to be &amp;quot;valid&amp;quot; so you feel good enough to pay next year&amp;#39;s tuition, unfortunately leaving employers with no other choice but to look for other more reliable proxies of learning like race, gender, and physical appearance.
