blending nuts in a blender with water. don't buy store bought nut milks if you can help if because they all have shit like xanthum gums and gums soak up nutrients in your system and irritate your interior lining. avoid gums in general if you can help it.\n\nmilk will feminize you more then soy will. in fact, studies have shown that soy products don't contain the same kind of estrogen that is the female hormone that feminizes women. and your body actually requires some forms of estrogen to properly function just like women require some forms and amount of testosterone to properly function. and if you respond to this by calling me a bug man then all jokes aside your just anti nutrition.\n\nthe problem is having too much of anything and also gmo soy which is fucked up. soy blocks are mass concentrations of edamame beans, tempeh is probably healtier. if you take martial arts, soy products aren't going to turn you into a woman.\n\ndon't take multivitamin pills that have magnesium sterate, get powders if you can afford it instead. take algee instead of krill oil. if you are a meat eater, eat organ meats.\n\nwhey protein, pea protein, and peanut protein are not good for you (as protein supplements or any whey at all), whey is the most unhealthy, avoid it as much as possible, pea protein is not great to have alot, and peanut protein is very dehydrating.\n\nyou don't have to worry about getting enough protein usually considering how accessible protein is in the modern era, you have to worry about bio diversity (having a diverse diet), and you have to avoid basic carbs like crazy. basic carbs like too much bread or rice or corn or what ever, really basic foods with low nutritive value that are rich in carbohydrates will put bitch tits on you more then edamame will. you need to eat moist fruits and vegables and keep hydrated and eat lots of healthy fats and just work out like a mother fucker if you want to be virile and physically fit. \n\nthe best protein supplement if you really are going to be a faggot about it is bio diversity, but second to that, savi seeds.\n\nthe best way to keep hydrated is to soak chia seeds in water for a while until it gets a gelatinus exterior and then drinking that in a beverage.\n\nsoak beans and nuts and seeds in water to prevent them from dehydrating you and aging you.\n\ntake martial arts. you will need to work on footwork and dexterity and striking and grappling and pressure points if you need to learn how to fight right now in that order. or if you want to just generally be disciplined and ascend to a higher state of being then you need to focus on footwork and dexterity and pressure points and grappling and striking in that order.\n\nif you aren't getting laid, looking at porn and jacking off once a week isn't going to kill you or even fuck up your life and will in fact actually help you not wind up like elliot rodger. \n\nwomen are attracted to physical competence and mental competence and dominance. they like confident men who are passionate, who are pursuing some higher path (both a career and a spiritual aim) and are making progress, who are physically stronger then other men and mentally smarter then other men. women might say that they want equality but no chick is going to come home after a long day at work to a fat and uneducated man who is a stay at home dad who is spent all day watching netflix and find them super attractive. women will find you attractive if you have these traits even if you are ugly, the only ugliness that is a deal breaker is if you got facial bones that look like they are broken in and you look like a sewer monster from horrible birth defects or accidents, and even then its possible to find a chick who will fuck you because some chicks are into getting fucked by monsters, but generally you will still have to strive to be strong in some way (mentally, physically, spiritually, etc) this is why musicians get laid all the time even though they might be total faggots, because they are still musicians and thats a spiritual and mental skill that they dominate at.\n\nthe biggest turn off to a woman is when you devestated by them not giving you what you want from them, and the biggest turn on for women is feeling like their sexuality is out of their control and in your control. learn how to choke girls and slap girls during sex without hurting them or making them call the cops. \n\na woman will tell other woman you are the best sex they have ever had if you learn shibari because its a very pretty and elegant and drawn out ritualistic way of tying up a woman in a sexual context and like i've said, women fucking love having their sexuality being out of their control. i have never seen a woman in more ecstacy then i have seeing a woman tied up in shibari.\n\nget a good water filter.\n\nlearn calculus and programming and learn another language, i suggest mandarin or cantonese considering all the asian gentrification
