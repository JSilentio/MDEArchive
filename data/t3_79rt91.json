We were returning from our expedition to the smoldering wastelands of Neo-Nova Yorque. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was while passing through familiar terrain in the forest near chapterhouse in Yellowstone Park that Brother Testos first heard a sound, I think he said it was a rustle in the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stopped to listen. Nothing. We trekked on. It was late. We were tired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there they were, blocking the path. They seemed to close and so far away at the same time. I will never forget this moment.

I drew my sword and immediately sliced into the pink flesh. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even with the blade lodged in its thick side, the creature managed to strike me with two forceful blows. I withdrew my sword roughly and hacked again at the creature&amp;#39;s side. A third slash at its shoulder incapacitated it. It wiggled on the ground, making a strange, doleful sound, a kind of gurglig mixed with a low wheeze. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What must have been loud clashes of battle were inaudible to me as my eyes fixed on the dying creature. I could hear only the strange dying gurgle-wheeze of the pink fleshed creature dying before me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the final one from the first wave fell to Brother Testos&amp;#39;s blade, those still standing off from us broke into a series of quick, rhythmic hoots occasionally punctured by the aforementioned toots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had suffered no casualties so far, but I think we all felt a great sense of foreboding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brother Eubronymus, I think it was, spoke with chilling calmness: &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ve flanked us. The fucking monsters are flanking us.&amp;quot; Apparently sensing that they had been spotted, dozens of pinkers began to rush at us from between the trees. We were outnumbered, tired. I was young. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is it. I knew I was going to die. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when the Seneschal turned his head and cried out to me:\n&amp;quot;Locks, get the clopping hell out of here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He knew that I couldn&amp;#39;t last, that I was young. He did his duty as a leader, as a man, as a... father. For the Seneschal was like a father to me. To all of us. But especially to me. He did his duty whereas I failed to do mine. I could have fought and died honorably with the Seneschal but the Seneschal&amp;#39;s command is law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hoofs more than eager to obey, I turned tail and fled. Horrifying screams followed by sudden silences haunted me, but I had no time to register or contemplate them. All was a blur, my heart pumping forcefully as I ran. I did not dare to turn to look before I had come a great distance away and being half assured that they would not begin pursuit until having subdued my brothers completely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing. No sound of carnage, no shrieks or hooty-toots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran away as stealthily as I could and took a long, winding route to get to chapterhouse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Constantly I am haunted by thoughts of that fateful night. Why was I, the youngest of the bunch, the only to survive?
