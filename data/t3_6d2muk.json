However, the things I want to talk about can be said without knowing the whole story. What many of you probably already know, this show likes to &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; about race and does a pretty poor job at it. The show even has the audacity to tackle &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; and fails completely. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race + New York, I Love You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the extent of the first season&amp;#39;s attempt to talk/joke about race was pretty flat and mostly involved Aziz saying &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you think that&amp;#39;s a little racist?&amp;quot; Or it had the typical old white person saying some off-color comment about interracial couples. But the second season goes a bit harder on Whitey, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in the episode &amp;quot;New York, I love You&amp;quot;. This is essentially a standalone episode that I would recommend watching if you want to see the most blatant display of &amp;quot;fuck white people&amp;quot; ever in a television show. I will preface this by saying I am not your typical MDE Western White Race Protector. I&amp;#39;m watching and discussing the show with my hispanic girlfriend, who also agreed the episode was super over the top in portraying White people as the absolute worst. We talk about these subjects a lot actually, and it&amp;#39;s too bad our discussion ended in that consensus, instead of giving us good material to disect. &lt;strong&gt;Alright on to the episode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;New York, I love You&amp;quot; is a collection of short vignettes about peoples of colour who live in New York and struggle working their low-wage jobs, but at the end of the day they&amp;#39;re happier than the white folk. Every single white person in this episode is portrayed as unfaithful, ungrateful, rude, greedy, or cold. &lt;em&gt;Every Single One&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The show opens with an old white lady being racist to the first character. He&amp;#39;s a doorman for an apartment building and is asked to call this rich white guy if his wife comes (he has a younger woman with him). Obviously as he&amp;#39;s doing something for someone else, the wife finds the husband cheating on her and the Man yells at the doorman for not calling him. The mistress is also white and rude to him. As he&amp;#39;s in the break room his other minority friends joke about white people and how they don&amp;#39;t visit their parents. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next white bread cracker doesn&amp;#39;t please his deaf black wife and hasn&amp;#39;t gone down on her in 2 months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two white girls get in a cab and spoil a new movie that just came out to the cab driver. The cab driver lives in an apartment with a bunch of other cab drivers. They go out but get turned down at a club and instead meet these girls at restaurant their friend works at and have a good time despite their lives seeming so hard, which is essentially the vibe of the show: black folks know how to have a good time and are down to earth, while uptight whitey is rude and cold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s weird about this episode is that it&amp;#39;s so blatantly anti-white, while the rest of the show is only slightly that way. I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider it anti-white because I think that&amp;#39;s just how people talk about other races, and nobody is the good guy. Aziz has had two gf&amp;#39;s/love interests and they&amp;#39;re both white. His best friend is white. There&amp;#39;s no white villain in the show, and every race gets their fair share of assholes representing them. The episode doesn&amp;#39;t fit the show at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This show is completely out of touch with money, plain and simple. Aziz&amp;#39;s character hosts a television show, but even when he was a no-name actor, he was eating out all the time, drinking, traveling, etc. His friends do it too and they all seem to be free all the time despite apparently being rich as fuck. The problem is the show tries to be relatable, but you know when you&amp;#39;re watching a show not specifically &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; rich people but the characters are obviously rich? They&amp;#39;re trying to appeal to people of all classes, but when your main character is eating fancy food and drinking wine every other scene it comes off as tone deaf. The episode I discussed showed poorer people struggling, but would bringing Aziz down closer to that level not be better for the poor 20 somethings watching the show? Viewers see him travel to Italy and easily transition from being a pasta apprentice to hosting a TV show, while eating every food imaginable. It just baffles me how people think the show &amp;quot;understands us&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;gets it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright I know this has been a long and rambling post about a show you didn&amp;#39;t watch because it&amp;#39;s about a woke Indian manlet, but stick with me: This show is really good not counting all of the stuff I mentioned. The way the story is told, the camerawork, the writing, the experimental narrative styles and scenes. There were some really affecting scenes and I feel so passionate about the show because it&amp;#39;s damaged so badly by these issues. The show isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;woke&amp;quot; and it doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;tackle race&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;, but damn if it isn&amp;#39;t better than most shows made these days.
