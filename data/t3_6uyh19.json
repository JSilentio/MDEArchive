Human fetuses are human. But in my view they only get the rights that their parents want them to have. Who is the best guide for your child? You or me? Do you really want me to take your kid away because I don't like the stuff you're teaching him?\n\nParents are dictators only in the scope of their children. I won't be able to tell your child what to do. Why are you assuming parents are just going to kill their own kids if laws vanish? Parents DIE for their kids. If laws are the only thing making parents love their kids then we as a species deserve to go extinct. \n\nAnd if an abused child grows up and learns how badly he was treated in youth who are they going to revolt against? The government? Or their own abusive parents?  I also forgot to mention that government should just stay out of family matters even murder etc... Family stuff should be handled internally. When a man and wife get married they are literally consenting to everything their spouse wishes to do to them. If a wofe hates her abusive husband and decides to slit his throat at night then he consented to getting killed by getting married to a woman who'd kill him. She should never be arrested or anything. This sounds like a whiteknighty idea bit I'd argue the same for kids killing their father or father killing his whole family. It sounds fucked up but again, why would any father do that even if the laws didn't exist to prevent him? We survived for a million years without laws. Animal families function just fine.  So will we. But animals don't have authoritarian governments dictating what children need to learn or face prison.\n\nSo you're saying people who want to brainwash other people will control education and you want to control education? Do you not see the irony here?\n\nThere is no objective reality. All objectivity rests on our faulty subjective senses and brains and presuppositions. We could all be in a matrix right now without feeling any different and you still consider your reality objective?! The hubris!\n\nTHG wouldn't be up to you. You could start your own if you want as long as your participants all consent. There doesn't have to be just one hunger games.\n\nA lone teacher brainwashing 20 kids is NOTHING to a government brainwashing 20 MILLION kids. I'll take the former thanks. At least that teacher can be fired and the students can be moved to a diff school without bloodshed.

Human fetuses are human. But in my view they only get the rights that their parents want them to have. Who is the best guide for your child? You or me? Do you really want me to take your kid away because I don&amp;#39;t like the stuff you&amp;#39;re teaching him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parents are dictators only in the scope of their children. I won&amp;#39;t be able to tell your child what to do. Why are you assuming parents are just going to kill their own kids if laws vanish? Parents DIE for their kids. If laws are the only thing making parents love their kids then we as a species deserve to go extinct. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if an abused child grows up and learns how badly he was treated in youth who are they going to revolt against? The government? Or their own abusive parents?  I also forgot to mention that government should just stay out of family matters even murder etc... Family stuff should be handled internally. When a man and wife get married they are literally consenting to everything their spouse wishes to do to them. If a wofe hates her abusive husband and decides to slit his throat at night then he consented to getting killed by getting married to a woman who&amp;#39;d kill him. She should never be arrested or anything. This sounds like a whiteknighty idea bit I&amp;#39;d argue the same for kids killing their father or father killing his whole family. It sounds fucked up but again, why would any father do that even if the laws didn&amp;#39;t exist to prevent him? We survived for a million years without laws. Animal families function just fine.  So will we. But animals don&amp;#39;t have authoritarian governments dictating what children need to learn or face prison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re saying people who want to brainwash other people will control education and you want to control education? Do you not see the irony here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no objective reality. All objectivity rests on our faulty subjective senses and brains and presuppositions. We could all be in a matrix right now without feeling any different and you still consider your reality objective?! The hubris!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THG wouldn&amp;#39;t be up to you.
