There's an incredible shitload of it in the ground in huge wells, and even more in the poles, it's what fracking is done for basically.\n\nThere's also something to be said about [Clathrate gun hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis) which is pretty fucking terrifying if you read into it, though it's not 100% proven yet, it is a definite possibility that it was the cause of the Permian mass extinction, except the Permian extinction took 100's of thousands of years to happen, while we're seeing similar changes in only a few decades, with every consecutive year breaking temperature records. Factor in the further acidification of the ocean with CO2 causing carbonic acid to form in the ocean and damaging coral reefs, things are close to certain to get really bad really quickly. Also, Simply removing CO2 and greenhouse gasses also doesn't stop a positive feedback loop of increasing temperatures, it's something that normally slowly subsides over tens of thousands of years.\n\nI do recognize that there have been huge strides in renewable energy, and I also believe we'll be seeing very efficient renewable energy sources much sooner than 30 years, probably more like 10 or 15 imo, I am pretty certain that we will at least see a mass extinction, huge vast migrations of immigrants, economic disasters and more, though I do still have faith in human ingenuity and I believe civilization won't collapse as whole. What I do believe is that climate change will severely impact the way we live in many different ways and that the future looks vastly different than any of us can imagine in the coming decades, and it will be humanities biggest challenge imo.

There&amp;#39;s an incredible shitload of it in the ground in huge wells, and even more in the poles, it&amp;#39;s what fracking is done for basically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also something to be said about &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis\"&gt;Clathrate gun hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty fucking terrifying if you read into it, though it&amp;#39;s not 100% proven yet, it is a definite possibility that it was the cause of the Permian mass extinction, except the Permian extinction took 100&amp;#39;s of thousands of years to happen, while we&amp;#39;re seeing similar changes in only a few decades, with every consecutive year breaking temperature records. Factor in the further acidification of the ocean with CO2 causing carbonic acid to form in the ocean and damaging coral reefs, things are close to certain to get really bad really quickly. Also, Simply removing CO2 and greenhouse gasses also doesn&amp;#39;t stop a positive feedback loop of increasing temperatures, it&amp;#39;s something that normally slowly subsides over tens of thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do recognize that there have been huge strides in renewable energy, and I also believe we&amp;#39;ll be seeing very efficient renewable energy sources much sooner than 30 years, probably more like 10 or 15 imo, I am pretty certain that we will at least see a mass extinction, huge vast migrations of immigrants, economic disasters and more, though I do still have faith in human ingenuity and I believe civilization won&amp;#39;t collapse as whole.
