All kids are healthy. My sister in law is pregnant for the first time at 40, and all genetic tests are clear. I'm getting my eggs frozen this month, mostly for peace of mind. No guarantees of anything \u2014 far from it. But I've seen this many times in my personal life and with my closest friends \u2014 not just with celebrities!\n\nThat said, the more I hang out in different forums (Reddit and otherwise), talk with friends and relatives, and really think, the more it's helping me figure out where I stand and what will make me happy. Yes, even the harsh criticisms help. The empathetic ones. All of it helps give me a 360-degree view on the situation and figure out what my own POV is.\n\nI'm coming to the conclusion that, regardless of egg freezing, I would most likely be happiest focusing on being the best me possible, pursuing my career further, embarking on creative pursuits, being spiritual, traveling, exercising, being healthy \u2014 and then having a healthy, happy partnership with a man, whether divorced or never married. I'd love to be a stepmom. I'm blessed to be an aunt and godmother.\n\nAnd if it came down to it and I really felt this burning desire to be a mom, I'm thinking I'd adopt. The man I'm in a long-distance relationship with is also 40, and an amazing human being. If things work out with us, I'd consider adopting with him. I've come to the conclusion that I won't raise a child alone. It wouldn't be fair to the child.\n\nI'm feeling a lot better since my original post. Listening, discussing, and debating has helped clear my head. I have a great life. I've had great experiences until now.

All kids are healthy. My sister in law is pregnant for the first time at 40, and all genetic tests are clear. I&amp;#39;m getting my eggs frozen this month, mostly for peace of mind. No guarantees of anything \u2014 far from it. But I&amp;#39;ve seen this many times in my personal life and with my closest friends \u2014 not just with celebrities!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, the more I hang out in different forums (Reddit and otherwise), talk with friends and relatives, and really think, the more it&amp;#39;s helping me figure out where I stand and what will make me happy. Yes, even the harsh criticisms help. The empathetic ones. All of it helps give me a 360-degree view on the situation and figure out what my own POV is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m coming to the conclusion that, regardless of egg freezing, I would most likely be happiest focusing on being the best me possible, pursuing my career further, embarking on creative pursuits, being spiritual, traveling, exercising, being healthy \u2014 and then having a healthy, happy partnership with a man, whether divorced or never married. I&amp;#39;d love to be a stepmom. I&amp;#39;m blessed to be an aunt and godmother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if it came down to it and I really felt this burning desire to be a mom, I&amp;#39;m thinking I&amp;#39;d adopt. The man I&amp;#39;m in a long-distance relationship with is also 40, and an amazing human being. If things work out with us, I&amp;#39;d consider adopting with him.
