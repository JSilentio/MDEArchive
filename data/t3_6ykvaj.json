My landlord of course.  I had given him so much money over the course of the last year. And he hadn\u2019t spent half of it.  It was just sitting in his bank account doing nothing.  That\u2019s what I couldn\u2019t stand. That\u2019s why I decided to mess with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least at first.  Then I got addicted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he was my partner in crime.  I could tell he kind of liked it and wanted me to keep on going.  So he never woke up and never figured out my tricks.  He just let himself get fooled so that I would get pleasure from it and keep on tricking him.  It was a symbiotic relationship.  The least he could offer me, given the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stipulated in our lease that if a repair was ever needed in my apartment,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a leaky faucet for example,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he would have to come and fix it.  But because the leaky faucet was not in my but in his apartment, over his bed, and over his head, I had found a loophole so that he could never fix it and it would keep on dripping forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the cube went a little far, at least the second or third one did, and all the cubes that followed.  I had a whole bag of them, like a sack of ice cold gems. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His wife hardly stirred.  She was innocent.  I was aware of that but I also knew she would get caught in the crossfire eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when he woke up and I put my index finger to my lips to signal that he not say anything, and he screamed, I didn\u2019t hesitate to put the bag around her head and use her as a weapon against him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was a big girl. She could take it.  At least that\u2019s what I told myself.  Besides, she was sitting on my rent money too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why all this fuss? Was it because I was black?  It all goes back to race sometimes. And I\u2019m only half black. Not that it matters.  (My mother is asian.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drip drip drip.  He couldn\u2019t stop me dripping even though I had his wife and was squeezing hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut, who are you?\u201d he asked.  At that point I could only laugh. I mean, who asks that kind of question at a time like this, when life hangs so precariously in the balance?  It doesn\u2019t matter who I am, just what I\u2019m doing and the kind of power I have.  Doesn\u2019t that make sense?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to him, and that\u2019s why I pushed her out of the window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a joy to watch him watch her, one last time, as she dropped.  He truly couldn&amp;#39;t understand.  6 whole stories. That should settle the score.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back at home I waited for the sound of sirens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cozy at last.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my bed.
