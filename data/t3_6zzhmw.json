Men aren't supposed to have these kind of thoughts. Especially the ones about woman not wanting to be with you. You're a man. Not a woman. Stop acting like a little bitch. Don't do anything stupid either just be the bigger man and keep things professional. \n\n\nAlso you must work in a really shit environment for people to be able to do this sort of thing and not be fired. Cause sorry if you were in my kitchen and you pulled that shit I'd fire you instantly. There's a reason you're supposed to report any sort of altercation to management immediately. So nothing like this happens. \n\nAlso if you're really thinking about killing yourself go out with a bang. Take a couple people with you. See you in hell.

I&amp;#39;m not going to blame women as a whole but there&amp;#39;s definitely something rotten about western culture in general right now and they&amp;#39;re definitely a part of it. I say they are a part of it because the state of women generally reflects the state of the social atmosphere, because most (most) women are social creatures, and conformists (this is their nature, it isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if YOU&amp;#39;RE the odd man out it&amp;#39;s YOUR fault. But if the predominant culture forces people to rid themselves of classical human virtues, it becomes unreasonable to expect some people to &amp;#39;join in&amp;#39; on this culture and achieve social &amp;#39;success&amp;#39;. Some people don&amp;#39;t care enough. Some people won&amp;#39;t rid themselves of those virtues I mentioned earlier. There are people who don&amp;#39;t have the will, and aren&amp;#39;t chameleon enough to adapt to these toxic environments that are becoming more and more common. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even if they don&amp;#39;t care, the isolation they experience will lead to depression. Humans need social contact and touch to function normally. Without it they become depressed and even suicidal like OP. The amount of people, especially men, being deprived of these things is certainly on the rise. What is the reason for this? It can&amp;#39;t be an individual&amp;#39;s problem if it&amp;#39;s affecting large masses of people, can it? It suggests that there is something wrong with culture, on an almost global scale. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6zzhmw/i_feel_like_shit/dmzbm8b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dmzbm8b", "created": 1505390385.0, "author_flair_text": "READ UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO", "created_utc": 1505361585.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6zzhmw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6zzhmw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6zzhmw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6zzhmw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6zzhmw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dmzefga", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sherdickofnuttingham", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dmzd15z", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I'm sure woman and most other people WOULD be happier in a system that didn't propagate a half-sick obsession-love philosophy.
