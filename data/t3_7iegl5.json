What IS virginity? Let's use the colloquial definition of virginity, that is \"A virgin is someone who has not rubbed their private parts on someone else's private parts for some duration of time\". Notice that you do not actually have to ejaculate, or reach orgasm, to lose your virginity. In order to lose your virginity you simply need to experience sex, which is the rubbing of genitals together, for some duration of time.\n\nGreat, so we know what it means to be a virgin, and what it means to lose your virginity. There is one thing you may not have noticed about this definition, however, and that is the duration of time that you must rub your privates against another person's privates in order to lose your virginity. Is a man who sticks his dick into a woman still a virgin if he cums immediately? No, that is silly. He has lost his virginity to that woman. Let's take this a bit further, is a man whose dick only grazes the vagina's entrance before cumming into it still a virgin? No, he is not, despite not even being able to feel the sexual contact. If that man's dick had not actually grazed the entrance to the vagina but only came infinitely close to touching it, well, he still would have experienced the same thing because in either situation he would have not felt it. Thus, we use deductive reasoning to determine that, while one must rub one's genitals against another's to lose one's virginity, this is the equivalent to one not rubbing his genitals against another's; that is to say, therefore, that one does not have to touch genital's with another to lose one's virginity. If one's imagination is able to offer a convincing enough experience, then one has lost their virginity outside of their imagination whilst only experiencing sex in their imagination.\n\nSo let's restate our definition of virginity. Taking the no-touch requirement we explored before into consideration. Virgin - \"a virgin is someone who has not experienced sex, whether that be physical or convincing imagined sex\". Someone who has lost their virginity - \"someone who has experienced sex, or has experienced convincing imaginary sex\". If convincing imaginary sex is in effect the equivalent to physical sex, let us define the term \"effective sex\". Effective sex - \"a life-changing experience, physical or mental, real or imagined, that causes one's identity to change in the sense that they no longer feel that the term 'virgin' and all the things associated with it can be used as an accurate descriptor of them anymore\".\n\nAh! Allow me to take a short, mental break after such a rigorous exploration of virginity. We will finish our thoughts afterwards.\n\n...\n\nLet's get back to it, fellow intellectuals! As Albert Einstein once said, no time like the present! Of course, Einstein's work (which many have said is merely a semantics-based interpretation of the work of other scientists who do not receive the name recognition he does) would later lead to the bombing of millions of innocent Japanese civilians. Burning women and children alive in their homes while their husbands were overseas fighting. If they had been with them at the time, however, they still would not have been able to defend against the bomb. Ba! Imagine, a Japanese army clanging their swords up against an atom bomb in a desperate attempt to defeat it. Ahahahahaha, it is quite humorous to conjure up such an image in one's mind, although it would be quite tragic to witness it. Metaphorically, I believe that intellectual exploration is as influential as Einstein (a Jewish man, by the way, which absolutely has nothing to do with his name recognition), but in a peaceful, less abrasive way. Like an atom bomb, a good intellectual argument is unable to be countered, no matter how much manpower or courage one possesses.\n\nSo the initial question which was proposed was whether or not watching an episode of Rick and Morty can be considered the equivalent to losing your virginity in the time-tested way of rubbing ones genitals against another's genitals until ejaculation or alternatively orgasm has been achieved. Well, from our prior deconstruction of virginity, we know that virginity is lost by participating in effective sex. Effective sex - \"a life-changing experience, physical or mental, real or imagined, that causes ones identity to change in the sense that they no longer feel that the term 'virgin' and all things associated with it can be used as an accurate descriptor of them anymore\". Well, to the question \"Can watching an episode of Rick and Morty be considered losing your virginity?\", I boldly answer YES - yes, of course it can! Think about it, when you watch Rick and Morty, how does it make you feel? For an intellectual, Rick and Morty touches them in ways normal media does not. It shatters their ego as an intellectual into pieces, alas not destroying it in its entirety, only with the most honest intentions of allowing them to deconstruct it in an even more intellectually robust form. Thus, if they were virgins prior to the viewing of said episode of Rick and Morty, the element of their ego, their identity that tells them \"yes, you identify as a virgin\" is now destroyed. Thus, for an intellectual, watching an episode of Rick and Morty is the equivalent to losing said intellectual's virginity. HOWEVER, I should note, that for a pleb, watching an episode of Rick and Morty will not have the same effect as he will not be able to truly understand it, and therefore his ego will not be shattered, as he will not even be able to comprehend the intellectualism the show presents in its true form. He may laugh, me may chuckle, but the intellectualism will be totally lost on him. Hell, he may even feel as if he understood it for its intellectual proposals. Perhaps he will tell people at parties that he has lost his virginity via Rick and Morty, but the pleb will know, and the people will know, if not too polite to call him out, that he has not truly lost his virginity. Only the intellectual's virginity is lost via watching an episode of Rick and Morty.\n\nI hereby conclude from this rigorous intellectual exploration of the question \"Does watching an episode of Rick and Morty cause you to lose your virginity?\" to be answerable, and that answer is \"YES! - If you are an intellectual, that is.\"\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Does watching an episode of Rick and Morty make you lose your virginity?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, first, let&amp;#39;s discuss what is virginity.
