Why shouldn&amp;#39;t Whites be supreme in the nations of their forefathers?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i know we&amp;#39;ve all be brainwashed with this idea that america is supposed to be a melting pot or at least a salad bowl, but nothing like that had ever been tried in history, with such radically different cultures, so who was to say it would work? and anyone who just glances can see that it largely isn&amp;#39;t. certain groups keep to themselves and other certain groups can be dangerous to go around. would i as a white guy be safe walking around in detroit, having no idea where i&amp;#39;m going, just wandering around aimlessly? would i be safe doing that in certain areas of chicago?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;why is it that the only nations in the world that actively promote multiculturalism are ones ran by white people? why is it that nowhere else is saying &amp;#39;we need more white people, it will make us BETTER... somehow!&amp;#39;???? why are we supposed to think that way, say that we need more of them, while they aren&amp;#39;t saying they need more of us? mathematically after a couple centuries of that type of asymmetric migration relationship around the globe, what kind of result will that inevitably lead to? anyone who says anything other than &amp;#39;LESS WHITE PEOPLE&amp;#39; is a liar or an idiot or kidding themselves or is a troll who just doesn&amp;#39;t care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the funny thing is that just saying &amp;#39;these policies will lead to less white people&amp;#39; is enough to make you a &amp;#39;WHITE NATIONALIST&amp;#39; or white supremacist. just the act of saying &amp;#39;i don&amp;#39;t think it makes sense to engage in policies that will result in less white people in countries that have been predominantly white&amp;#39; makes you a nazi. NOBODY would accuse people in india of being hitler if they got upset at a flood of white people pouring into the country, and lamented a loss of their own heritage or social position. it&amp;#39;s funny too because i actually saw people leading up to the election posting things like &amp;#39;white people are done, have fun being irrelevant&amp;#39;, comments along that line, a lot of them, some possibly just trolling and maybe even white (cucked liberals) themselves, but i saw a lot of comments like that and i&amp;#39;m sure some minorities saw a victory against trump that way and welcomed it. it&amp;#39;s based on a reality though. and for some reason reveling in the fact of this decline of white people or even the white male, doesn&amp;#39;t make you hitler, but simply expressing that maybe it&amp;#39;s NOT the best thing to happen, DOES.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5gqz6d/i_am_not_altright_politically_im_about_as_far/dawyc69/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dawyc69", "created": 1481176282.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1481147482.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dawldzd", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gothgirl420666", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t1_davxge2", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Yeah I definitely agree with you that WP was mostly innocuous and that the Daily Show is a far more insidious form of propaganda. \n\nBut in response to your point, Sam already was called a nazi, censored, lost his job, etc. so whatever strategy he's using to get past the censors isn't working. \n\nSouth Park for instance is widely beloved despite being vastly more offensive and directly mocking leftist types from a center-right stance.
