That being said, the people some would consider popular at a first glance vehemently oppose SJW BS, so much so that their corner of the lunchroom regularly had huge paper TRUMP banners taped to the wall. People will openly mock personal pronouns and assuming someone&amp;#39;s gender, and I&amp;#39;ve heard the old &amp;quot;I identify as an X&amp;quot; joke more times than I can count. The school itself is relatively peaceful, we used to have a lot more fights/incidents during my freshman year and before, but it&amp;#39;s changed. I remember one girl had her weave get ripped off my freshman year, but now we maybe get one good fight a year. As for bullying, it really doesn&amp;#39;t happen that much at all. There are weird kids, but they&amp;#39;re usually just left alone and made fun of behind their back. As for myself, I don&amp;#39;t play any sport or do any meaningful extracurriculars. I&amp;#39;d hesitate to say I have a lot of friends(maybe a core group of a few), but I&amp;#39;m on friendly terms with most of who some would consider the popular kids and hang out with them occasionally. As for drugs and alcohol I&amp;#39;d say almost all of these popular kids drink and maybe half smoke weed occasionally, but beyond that nothing. I&amp;#39;m actually pretty happy about my station in life. Maybe I&amp;#39;m a normie but I hang out on weekends with my friends and usually have a lot of fun. I anticipate a rude awakening coming soon where the harsh realities of life come crashing down on my sheltered childhood, but for now I&amp;#39;m going to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5dokc0/for_all_you_dudes_in_highschool_how_is_it_now/da72rzd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_da72rzd", "created": 1479602614.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1479573814.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5dokc0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "da71x0s", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DingusTron5000", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5dokc0", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I'm a senior in a school for retards and rejects.
