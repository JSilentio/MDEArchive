I love all of us. I care about the well being of us all. When we win, God, when we win..... Cannot be described. The hedonist life of constant yearning for unobtainable pleasure that your peers seek is nothing like what will become of our victory. I have said this before, and yet i just cannot say it enough times: Eons of time have lead up to my existence. A lowly peasant man who stole a loaf of bread must have been sent to the New World. A land unlike anything anybody from the Old World had seen. He must have experienced true lovecraftian fear, a fear of true unknown. He eventually settled down in this new settlement and married other poor peasant and had some sort of a family and died. That was his entire existence summed up. He lived and suffered just so his children could live and suffer...... Why? Through his work, he made the lives of his children , though still particularly difficult, much easier for them. This happened over and over and over and over for decades. Somebody might have married some native. Somebody might of died in some war he didn't understand and was forever forgotten. Somebody might have been somebody. That's who we want to be, Somebody. My ancestors lived, and died..... and thats ALL they did for thousands of years. I live now in this point in time where everything too be known in known. People grow up wanting to be Instagram models and livestreamers. People have power in this world, they just need to use it. We ARE social beings. We have power. They would rather consume and watch as their very humanity is stolen from them. And they let it happen because they are told it is good. The people that demand that you care about global warming are the ones who consume the most garbage and yell at poor people. They do nothing but hold us back. This negativity does nothing but hold us back. This sense that anybody can look at themselves and others and say \"Well, nothing matters, I don't matter, Universe does not care about us\" Is complete and utter Putrid Garbage. How the fuck can you not give a shit about that stuff and then tell me to give a fuck about the planet? How the fuck can you tell me I don't give a shit about victims of rape or assault when you consume media produced by child rapists?

I care about the well being of us all. When we win, God, when we win..... Cannot be described. The hedonist life of constant yearning for unobtainable pleasure that your peers seek is nothing like what will become of our victory. I have said this before, and yet i just cannot say it enough times: Eons of time have lead up to my existence. A lowly peasant man who stole a loaf of bread must have been sent to the New World. A land unlike anything anybody from the Old World had seen. He must have experienced true lovecraftian fear, a fear of true unknown. He eventually settled down in this new settlement and married other poor peasant and had some sort of a family and died. That was his entire existence summed up. He lived and suffered just so his children could live and suffer...... Why? Through his work, he made the lives of his children , though still particularly difficult, much easier for them. This happened over and over and over and over for decades. Somebody might have married some native. Somebody might of died in some war he didn&amp;#39;t understand and was forever forgotten. Somebody might have been somebody. That&amp;#39;s who we want to be, Somebody. My ancestors lived, and died..... and thats ALL they did for thousands of years. I live now in this point in time where everything too be known in known. People grow up wanting to be Instagram models and livestreamers. People have power in this world, they just need to use it. We ARE social beings. We have power. They would rather consume and watch as their very humanity is stolen from them. And they let it happen because they are told it is good. The people that demand that you care about global warming are the ones who consume the most garbage and yell at poor people. They do nothing but hold us back. This negativity does nothing but hold us back. This sense that anybody can look at themselves and others and say &amp;quot;Well, nothing matters, I don&amp;#39;t matter, Universe does not care about us&amp;quot; Is complete and utter Putrid Garbage. How the fuck can you not give a shit about that stuff and then tell me to give a fuck about the planet?
