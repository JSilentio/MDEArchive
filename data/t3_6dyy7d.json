By this I mean that is sees time as linear, i.e. heroic. In philosophical terms, Marxism has an eschatological worldview. It sees man as struggling towards some heroic end, and it regards the past and present in terms of this heroic struggle. The heroic understanding of time belongs to the warrior elite of the nomadic pastoral tribes - such as the Aryan tribes who invaded Europe during the Bronze Age. This is the worldview of C\u00fachulainn, who goes out actively seeking encounters with death, so as to carry out noble deeds for the eternal glory of his name and the name of his race. The warrior elite also includes the priests and philosophers of the tribe, who heroically face death on the battlefield of ideas. Merlin of Arthurian legend is one of the great Celtic examples of this kind of warrior philosopher. Fionn Mac Cumhail is also a warrior philosopher, who faces death in his visions of the future.\n\nIn complete contrast, the sedentary aboriginal farmers of Europe had a cyclical conception of time. Nothing really ever happened, because time just repeated itself over and over again, as the sun rises every morning, and the spring follows every winter. To be sure, sometimes the cycle of time needed some help, and this was the job of the shaman, who repaired time. To emphasize this point, among the peoples of this type it was forbidden to store surplus production for the next year. Seeds were kept for replanting, but grain was not kept for future consumption. All surplus production had to be destroyed in ritual sacrifice. And such tribes and practices still exist today. To store surplus production would be to tell the Virgin Spring that Her return was not needed again. Heroic ideas of struggle for some idealistic end is entirely alien to the worldview of such people.\n\nWell, the thing is that the cyclical idea of time remains the idea of time of the vast majority of Europeans today. They know about dates and the calander, and that Napoleon lived before Hitler, but that is just stuff learned off and not part of their real comprehension of the world. Europeans don't expect anything to really change, and they don't want anything to really change. The task of Marxism was always to give the ordinary person an heroic view of time, i.e. to effectively change the sedentary underclass of Europe into intellectual aristocrats. This was the task James Connolly set himself. One can hardly imagine any event in all of history that was more aristocratic and heroic in its conception and practice than the 1916 Rising.\n\nOn the other hand, Liberalism also has the cyclical view of time - as Francis Fukuyama pointed out. Because Liberalism itself comes from the sedentary underclass who worked their way up to being the bourgeois servants of the aristocrats. The Liberal thinks that the world was always a liberal marketplace, and always will be a liberal marketplace, and his only role in life is to keep his head down and accumulate what he can. And an extreme example of that is Chuck Feeney - or Bill Gates. They nibble and gnaw their lives away accumulating billions - and then - like the good old neolithic farmers - they give it all away so that they get right back to where they started. And this is why Liberalism is so much easier for the average person to understand than Marxism is - and why so many real aristocrats have always been fascinated by Marxism.
