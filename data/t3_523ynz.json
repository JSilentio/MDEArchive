But if you read enough of this shit you realize that's not the endgame plan--the plan is to have anything white/masculine/traditional totally eliminated or suppressed.\n \n&gt;A year or two back, I might've said the most important issues were... surveillance, ending the war on drugs, campaign finance reform, military adventurism--something like that. But I've grown weary of having all this feminist nihilist shit plopped on my lap, and I'm tired of people telling me that I've got some original sin and the only way to cleanse myself is by acting like Tim Wise. Gamergate was eye-opening, #BlackLivesMatter was eye-opening, but what really drove the point home and crystalized this perspective was reading about things like Rotherham...\n \n&gt;Europe is in a dire situation: culture is being destroyed, some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps, and a lot of these places might not ever be the same. I don't think that's a good thing, or a healthy thing, to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are 10-20x more likely to rape. I'm sorry I just don't think that's good, I know it's insensitive as hell, but it's too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently. This is just the way it is, Europe is being invaded and we'd better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here.\n \n&gt;It's possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate. Send them money, let them use the technology we invented, give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty, quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good, but by keeping borders open we're taking the most productive, inventive, civilized, free countries and dumping them into the incinerator. Of course we have problems, of course the NSA is bad, of course it would be nice if we could all have $15 an hour for whatever, but would you rather live here, or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia? Do you really think the best way to make our society more Utopian is by importing displacement levels of Malays, Chinese, or Saudis?\n \n&gt;Whether you think the problem is genetic or cultural, it doesn't matter when you import immigrants in large numbers, because they form communities that don't integrate. They bring their language and their religion with them, and they vote for socialist policies. This will continue until white people have been sucked dry, and then there won't be any voting anymore, there'll be Sharia law instead. We're putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we're worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us.\n \n&gt;We didn't build all this shit and invent all this shit, our ancestors did--it's only ours to safeguard, not to flush down the toilet. You didn't get burned at the stake for saying something heretical, your ancestors did, so it's pretty fucking shameful if you're ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you. These fuckers have shifted everything so far out of wack and to not fight back now is the same thing as being on their side.\n \n&gt;Comedy shouldn't be 'political'... Sensitive WASPy types don't like when things get publicly political. Sam Hyde is funny I just wish he wouldn't be 'political'... First of all, nobody even BATS A FUCKING EYE when Zach Galifianakis or Jim Carrey dips into some political issue that they know nothing about (because their views fall safely in the bubble of insanity that is societally accepted as 'OK'). Secondly.... THIS ISN'T EVEN POLITICAL! The slow smothering death of Western Civilization is not a political issue, it's a historical issue, as in we are toying with the fruits of 2000 years of bloody labor as if they're just piNata prizes.\n \n&gt;I don't want to shove politics in everyone's face all the time. I happen to think that free-market capitalism kicks socialism's ass and that spying and war are bad. I voted for Gary Johnson in 2012. If you think that a universal basic income is a good idea, or that weed should remain illegal, or think whatever about gay marriage, I don't care about those things enough to alienate viewers and I'm trying to shove my opinions in your face as little as possible. Even if you think that people are born boys and turn into girls, whatever, I think Bruce Jenner is really funny but I don't care enough to go beyond making jokes about ropes. But this isn't about politics, it's about having an identity and a home and not losing these beautiful civilizations that took so long to create.\n \n&gt;The future is headed towards Cormac McCarthy's The Road and talking/thinking about it gives you an uh-oh boo-boo feeling in your tummy because someone might call you waycis? A lot of people have been hitting me up recently to ask about this, and everybody comes to the same conclusion, they agree and can see what's happening, but addressing it head-on gives them a no-no feeling, like a bad. They feel a bad, and they worry that people will think they're bad racers, shame no-no.\n \n&gt;This doesn't mean you have to start hating black people or using racial slurs or deliberately making yourself unpopular at parties, but whites need to regain some sort of cohesive tribal self-interest and identity right now just like everybody else has or in fifty years this country is going to be like Brazil (the bad parts, not the sexy babes and beaches and rich dudes in white linen suits).
