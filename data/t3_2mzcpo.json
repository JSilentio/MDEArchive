Build a social networking company which analyzes facebook data, finds kids who are social persuaders, i.e. they have a large number of facebook friends, and then we individually intercept them someplace between school and home, and persuade them to start chewing brand X gum and tell their friends, teach him how to blow a bubble, how to stick it in a girl&amp;#39;s hair to impress his friends, and always have the kid keep 5 extra packs of gum, incase he needs to give them out ect and then the kid can make a cool $80 a month to do that.  He&amp;#39;s 13 so $80 is a lot.  Think about it, hes 13 so he&amp;#39;s got no other options to get money, then we get him tweeting ads (only ones which they agree are funny) to their friends, and then we get him on a new product, say a T-shirt brand.  We use facebook network graph analysis to find the most influential and popular kid in 6th grade, and he gets $300 a month to wear the shirt we give him (we&amp;#39;ll make sure to get one with a nice big logo on the front so everyone can go home and order it online)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Culture is no longer changing back and forth randomly, but is progressing at the maximum rate by the addition of the power of capialism.  Find the next bubbling cultural trend, and then jump on the kids in charge, and kick them some money to get your brand sold.  E.g. Say goth makes a comeback.  Our guys will analyze facebook graphs to find the key &amp;quot;kingpins&amp;quot; group of kids who are behind this comeback in goth at your school of choice, then we go in, tell all of them they could be sponsored, hook them up with some expensive but totally wicked goth clothes made by a professional designer.  Not the cheap ass stuff they would buy at Spencer&amp;#39;s gift shop.  I want you to believe we are doing them a service here.  They want to be goth, OK, we&amp;#39;ll show them the right way to be goth.  And we will remind them that stealing from their parents to buy a sick necklace is TOTALLY GOTH.  Fuck McDees, McDees will laugh in our face if we offer this proposition.  What we do, is we find the failing hotdog stand down the street, tell the owner we can make them the standard for 14 year old goth kids +their friends + their friends friends, looking for lunch.  He does the calculations, realizes &amp;quot;holy shit&amp;quot; with an estimated 100 extra customers a day, he would go from breaking even to being able to expand.  The lesson here: Every subculture is exploitable.  Its all about judicious choice in giving the people what they REALLY want.  We took those goth kids from being generic urban outfitters wearing, mcdonalds eating faggots, to wearing designer goth clothes, and eating real 100% beef hotdogs.

Its just a matter of how many &amp;quot;interceptors&amp;quot; we can train in the arts of manipulating 13 year olds, and we will own the teenage market, and own the world!
