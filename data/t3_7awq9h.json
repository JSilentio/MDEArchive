I try to explain to people that college can be fun as you can easily troll the professors by feigning ignorance rather than pronouncing statements as true. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) In a cultural anthropology course, I told the class that homosexuality was a genetic mistake and went scot free. The professor was talking about homosexuality and she said that the mere fact that it exists means its a good thing evolutionarily, else it would have evolved out. I raised my hand and asked, rather than stated &amp;quot;one of my friends told me that sickle cell anemia was a byproduct of the same genes that help prevent malaria, and that genes can have a benefit and an unintended consequence that will remain, how do I disprove him that genes can evolve and have an unintended negative side-effect?&amp;quot; and then she just explained that &amp;quot;yes, sometimes that happens etc etc&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I told my class that transexuals dont actually exist. While the professor was talking about transexuals and how they exist in different cultures etc, she started talking about how neat it was that such fluidity existed but that it could be confusing for people to keep track, saying things like &amp;quot;like what is a trans-woman lesbian, you know? Some people get confused and dont know if this refers to a man that became a woman or a woman that became a man, yeah its really interesting&amp;quot;. I raised my hand and said something along the lines of &amp;quot;i think that the confusion is caused by the society we live in. Its sad that society feels like they have to force people to adapt to its conventions and norms. When a man wants to rename himself &amp;#39;Cindy&amp;#39; and wear a wig and dress, society cant tolerate that so it forces &amp;#39;Cindy&amp;#39; to become a &amp;#39;woman&amp;#39;. If society would just let people be themselvs, then it woudl tolerate adn accept that Cindy is a man that wishes to wear dresses, wigs, and go by the name Cindy, which is perfectly normal. If it werent for society, we could just deal in the objective reality, and be ablke to say Cindy is a man that wears dresses and wigs, without making him have to conform to our outdated conventions about women wearing dresses and having long hair. Then there would be no confusion&amp;quot;, and she agreed with me that it was sad that society forced men like that to conform to be women, and she even added herself &amp;quot;and force them to get surgeries&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Black people would be naked and cold without whitey. When a professor was telling our class about &amp;quot;cultural appropriation&amp;quot;, I raised my hand and asked &amp;quot; oh, so its like how african-americans that live in America, use ipads and wear American clothing, like jeans? I dont think thats bad&amp;quot;, and then she went on to explain that that wasnt bad because reasons, didnt deny that it was &amp;quot;cultural appropriation&amp;quot; for niggers to have running water and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Something about feminism, i dont quite remember what it was, but a female student came up to me after class and thanked me for saying what everyone was thinking, and then wanted to give me her number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) When our professor made us read Guns, Germs, and Steal, and we had to write a research paper on it, I essentially wrote that GGaS explained that the reason blacks had a lower IQ than whites is because whites had just been lucky enough to be born on the equatorial lines yadayada, but I stated that whites were more intelligent, rather than denying it, which GGaS ironically does (explains WHY it is so, while trying to explain that it ISNT so). Got an A (fyi I got an A in all my classes all 4 years, except 2 for missing days).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) For another class, I wrote a short story about a mexican illegal that becomes legal and votes republican when realizing why she left mexico. In it, i explain that democracy is a bandwagon fallacy, in addition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) I told the class that vegetarianism leads to degeneracy. I was debating a fellow student during class about veganism/vegitariansim. Essentially he was stating that it was wrong to eat animals for the same reason that its wrong to eat humans, namely that they are equal to humans. I explained that that fallacy leads to other fallacies. I told him that in Judaism, they teach that God allowed humans to eat meat so that they remind themselves that they are above them, and that when tribes fell to the faulty belief that eating meat was wrong, they would then go on to see animals as equals to humans, and would have laws where a human would get killed for murder if he killed an animal, and would even lead to the fallacy of beastiality, since if animals are peers and equals, why is it wrong to have sex with them?
