Segmenting will now be a scientific term regarding style choice among humans, so it is now my word.\n\nBy segmenting each body part with different colors and types of clothing it allows a prospective mate to more easily focus on whatever trait they find desirable. If you got a nice ass and no tits u don't wanna wear a sundress because it groups the two traits, one positive one negative, together. This amplifies the negative and minimizes the positive until they are equal, which is no bueno.\n\nSegmenting is the way clothing is now, we've subconsciously done this to ourselves much like animals would do over generations and generations. Your grandfather slayed poon because he decided to stop wearing suspenders and segment his body.\n\nSegmenting has become a thing because sexual selection is no longer based on the providing of resources as much as it is about who looks the best physically.\n\nThere's a reason we live in the future but breathable spandex body suits aren't a thing, because nothing would be segmented and everything would just blend together in the mess that is your body. But you slap on some jeans, a tight Dr. Who graphic Tee Tee (new speak) and some converse (Connies) and you're not looking half bad. Congrats, a girl might playfully punch you in the arm and you'll flinch because someone broke the touch barrier you created when you were a child after you were molested (Mo Mo'd) by that older kid in your neighborhood.\n\nChokers therefore segment the face from the bosom, which is why fat girls wear them so much, because their faces are lumpy mash potatoes and their tits are nice and plump like a pig's ballsack. It's easier to fuck them because you can dissociate their tits from their face.\n\nChokers Come with Consequences\n\nThe arteries of the neck can become blocked or completely fused with the trachea, the spine can slowly separate from the lower brain causing paraplegia. You can segment all you want but no one's gonna fuck you when you can only move your eyes and your muscles atrophy and you're just a bag of flesh and bones.\n\nThe worst consequence only deemed a consequence to some is pregnancy as a result of higher sexual marketplace value. Let's face it, if you're wearing a choker you're probably fat. Picture a young fat girl holding onto her baby like a chimp as CPS pries it away. \"Mah B.B., mah B.B.! Deyre taken mah B.B.!\" She screams. Very primal.\n\nAlso chokers are the most abrasive neck segmenter. There are scarves and necklaces, one is for utility and the other shows status, the choker does neither, it only segments.\n\nIn our next session I will teach Segmentation Inflation theory, which states that the more society segments the more inhuman we will become.
