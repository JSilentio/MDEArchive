It&amp;#39;s a difficult life long process, and the minute you think you are guaranteed salvation the demons will whisper in your ear to undermine that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God\u2019s kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off&amp;quot;Romans 11:22 &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s something we must always strive towards, the point of life is Theosis/divinization and to become like God ourselves, and to do so means trying to do everything in our lives to become more like Christ we possibly can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby justified. It is the Lord who judges me&amp;quot; (1 Cor. 4:4)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I pummel my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified&amp;quot; (1 Cor. 9:27)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&amp;quot; (Philippians 2:12)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lord himself tells us&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away&amp;quot; (Luke 8:13)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;is an article about it &lt;a href=\"https://www.catholic.com/tract/assurance-of-salvation\"&gt;https://www.catholic.com/tract/assurance-of-salvation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The protestant answer of trying to make things simpler/easier and tell people for sure has led many souls astray, demons will always be attacking us and we must always be extremely vigilant. However those who reject the Body of Christ (the Church) and the teachings of Apostles I do not really expect will be saved. If you reject his Body because it doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;seem consistent&amp;quot; and you want to have assurance of your salvation then you will have no salvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/67zbfk/charls_carroll_gonna_be_a_good_boy/dgvv6rk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dgvv6rk", "created": 1493444799.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1493415999.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dgvu09o", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "leditor999888", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dguqjm2", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; It simply isn't rational to claim that Scripture is the only basis for a Church, when what Scripture is itself is based on that Tradition.\n\nCannon is based on the judgement of man, but what puts protestant theology over catholic in my book is that protestant theology is far more consistent with itself that catholic theology (for instance church membership as a prerequirement for salvation is in clear contradiction with salvation by faith or by faith &amp; works).\n\nCatholic theology doesnt even make a clear claim about salvation (and orhodox theology is almost identical on salvation matter).", "edited": 1493414770.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It simply isn&amp;#39;t rational to claim that Scripture is the only basis for a Church, when what Scripture is itself is based on that Tradition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cannon is based on the judgement of man, but what puts protestant theology over catholic in my book is that protestant theology is far more consistent with itself that catholic theology (for instance church membership as a prerequirement for salvation is in clear contradiction with salvation by faith or by faith &amp;amp; works).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Catholic theology doesnt even make a clear claim about salvation (and orhodox theology is almost identical on salvation matter).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/67zbfk/charls_carroll_gonna_be_a_good_boy/dgvu09o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dgvu09o", "created": 1493443241.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1493414441.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dguqjm2", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sdv92348h2f0h8240h", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 0, "parent_id": "t1_dgupown", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Well we had the Apostles to guide us, it's not just that one verse.
