have this very vulnerbale and impressionable group of people being fed ideas like math, science, and literacy are elements of oppressive white culture. this is a thing thats been seen historically quite often, not just with black people but with whites too (see soviet russia) where people who feel like they need to engage in some sort of revolt or revolution see the education that belonged to the community that they are rebelling against as a kind of indoctrination and try to deny or reject it. \n\ni've seen black people getting mad at other black people for \"acting white\" by enounciating their words in a non ebonics fashion or for reading a book. black people have gotten mad at teachers and accused them of being racist for marking them down for their bad grammer and spelling by saying its racist against their culture of ebonics n'shiet. i don't think this is ingrained, i think the culture promotes and incubates this kind of behaviour. social media and mainstream media promotes this kind of shit. \n\nthe daily stormer even did an article acknowledging gucci mane for becomming slightly more aware of the JQ when gucci mane said that he used to not even know what a jew was and wouldn't be able to recognize him but when Ice T pointed out to him that all the executives were jewish, now when ever he sees a white guy in a suit he is suspicious of that about him and if this guy is going to tell him that \"he needs to be more ghetto in his music videos\". people accuse gucci mane of not being the same person now that he's come out of prison and instead having been replaced with a look alike or a clone simply because gucci mane cleaned up his act and got in shape and got married and doesn't rape about drugs and crime as much any more. \n\nit was part of the plan of the creation of the federal reserve that bankers that control the media were going to try and create a conflict between blacks and whites. in the sixties, black education, crime, and parenting was actually better then it was now, with only 25 percent of black people born out of wedlock as opposed to around 70 percent now. \n\nso you can't just look at government handouts and advancements in technology and say that blacks have a \"good\" environment. \n\nits not like the era we are in right now is directly the next step in time right after slavery, there was a shit ton of time between now and slavery where alot has gone on, culture got worse at the end of slavery culminating with ww2, then it got better culminating with jfk, then its gotten worse again until clinton, then it got better ending with 911, then it got worse until now. \n\nrobert e lee even said that he thought that slavery was evil, but at the same time might have positives, in that it might be a good transitional experience for black people to grow and change from what they came from (the shit holes in africa) to modern western society, he said that if you just brought them into western society with no transitional experience they won't be able to handle or understand and assimilate to western society and they would just fuck it up or self destruct. whats going on now is, with culture and with the handouts of the state, a slavery or just after slavery culture for black people is being created. where instead of focusing on self improvement and joining with the best attributes of other cultures and becomming part of the american identity, they are focused on reparations and racial revenge and gimmie dats and hedonistic pleasure and reverse coloniolization. \n\nits not enough to just have better nutrition, you have to given positive reinforcement for ways of life that don't suck.\n\nlook at toussaint louverture. he was a black leader that lead the first successful slave revolt that the american revolution was largely inspired by, withs some saying that the american constitution was largely based on the haitian constitution. he was raised by a white slave owner who was rather compassionate to him and allowed him to receive an education from local christian monks, and he was so cultured that many people refused to even beleive that he was black because they couldn't believe that black people were capable of being so sophisticated. he was so cultured that he had trouble controlling many of his own troops becuase they rejected him and thought of him as a race traitor by not wanting to simply wipe out white people and also actually rather likeing alot of what white culture had to offer, he simply wanted to create a better nation where people could be free and black people could experience the same growth that he did, he didn't want \"racial revenge\" like alot of the people who were underneath him wanted, and that was ultimately his downfall.\n\nthe mulattos (half blacks) refused to side with the full blacks for the most part because they thought of full blacks as essentially niggers and wanted to stay with the french, and the full blacks were so uneducated and had such a bad culture that large chunks of them weren't able to get with the program because they didn't have the upbringing that toussaint had. when toussaint freed haiti from slavery, he still mandated that as a citizen you either had to work (preferably on a farm) or you had to join the military, and alot blacks simply wanted to just go to private land and farm just enough to feed them selves or their family, not realizing that if they did that then haiti would just be conquered again and they would be slaves again. they believed shit like toussaint was just continuing slavery by another name when infact they were getting paid, had rights as citizens, didn't belong to someone else, and had days off. there were infact blacks that did side with him, but one of his high ranking generals staged a coup and betrayed him to the french and took over. and then when the french betrayed his general, Jean-Jaques Dessalines, that general betrayed the french and reignited the haitian revolution but with an added twist of deciding to commit genocide of all french people in haiti. something that toussaint wouldn't do.\n\nso i think there may in fact be a possibility that IQ can be raised within demographics, but it takes a strong surrounding culture that is willing to take stands and appear racist or bigoted by saying \"this kind of culture is good, this kind of culture is shit. being a gang banger is some nigger shit, fucking read about economics and study math and stop being a dumb nigger, whats wrong wit chu\"\n\nyou can point and say \"actually even black people raised by white people still have lower iqs on average\", but what is the iq of these white people? and how much do they try and be assertive in giving their black child a good upbringing? most of them i feel have a relatively hands off approach to raising them because they don't want to stomp out their black identity for fear of being racist. most black people or half black people with white parents still identify with black culture and identity because black identity is given superficial and shallow privelege that is very attractive and the culture grooms this mentality. it takes a village to raise a child, its not enough to merely have white parents, those white parents have to help you belong to a good culture that doesn't indoctrinate you with neo liberal bullshit.
