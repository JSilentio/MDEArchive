Compare his behaviour in the 2013 BotW episodes and HitB episodes prior to that and he&amp;#39;s like this normal guy with a few funny traits and since then he&amp;#39;s been exaggerating everything. He (and sometimes Mike) always shout like retards so much during BotW that its stopped being &amp;quot;ironic&amp;quot; and is now just the same as other hyperactive youtubers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally Mike just straight up doesn&amp;#39;t care about film quality anymore since he pretty much gave a pass to any crap that came out in the last couple of years, saying he loved Jurassic World and Independence Day Resurgence because it was &amp;quot;shlock,&amp;quot; a word he just throws around to justify his shit taste. Dude is still hilarious, but its clear that whether he likes a film or not depends on his mood going into it and whether it reminds him of Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tldr: i&amp;#39;m gay&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/65srzj/is_redlettermedia_redpilled/dgd5s6a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dgd5s6a", "created": 1492435679.0, "author_flair_text": "\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0647\u0627\u064a\u062f", "created_utc": 1492406879.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65srzj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65srzj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dgdd2qf", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RemnantLegacy", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t1_dgd8vda", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "And in the Plinkett review for it Mike spends half the review backtracking talking about the prequels, then gives a complete non-review of TFA basically talking about nothing and offering no insight at all.
