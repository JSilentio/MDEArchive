All of these things are an outstretching for some form of meaning. He tries to contact his daughter that he has also been alienated from, he tries to make people laugh, he tries to be true to himself as an artist, but in the end, he witnesses the rape of comedy, with Michael Cera, the miscarriage of comedy, in the bathroom with the pregnant woman, the death of comedy at the party, and then finally the legacy of comedy: being reduced to a supporting character in a foreign sitcom.
