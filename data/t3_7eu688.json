My friend Dashim who works at Facebook was able to get me an interview, and I think it went quite well. After the interview they offered to give me a tour of the facility, which I happily accepted. I felt like I was in Willy Wonka\u2019s candy factory! The arcade and meditation rooms were amazing, and the sheer number of non-gendered bathrooms literally brought a tear to my eye. But the most impressive thing was the cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve never seen a cafeteria of that caliber. They had every coffee you could imagine along with baked goods like no other. Cake pops and muffins everywhere. And the cereal! They had every cereal I could think of! Froot Loops, Lucky Charms, Apple Jacks, Cookie Crisp, Oreo O\u2019s. Any cereal you could ever want! And don\u2019t get me started on the drink bar. They had soy milk, almond milk, hemp milk, breast milk, Soylent, Coca-Cola, Gatorade, Monster, Capri Sun, Sunny D, EVERYTHING. If I get the job I reckon I\u2019ll have to upgrade my MacBook because I imagine I\u2019ll be doing as much of my work as possible in the cafeteria haha!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Off to the side of the cafeteria there was a private room which drew my attention. I asked my guide what it was for and he told me it was a special room for the executives. He asked me if I wanted to see it and threw me a little wink and I just HAD to. Inside the room there were several Facebook employees hooked up to machines. It looked a lot like the Milk Bar in A Clockwork Orange, actually. Female employees who were on their period were paid time and a half to be on hand to dispense blood for Zuckerberg and the other executives. He explained that all employees carry company provided stainless steel water bottles, and that the executives were no exception (though theirs are filled with blood) and that this is where they refilled their blood bottles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have, of course, heard about the blood bottles around town already, but it was pretty amazing seeing it in person. A couple of the employees in there were in very odd, uncomfortable positions and I was worried that they might be being abused, so I asked my guide about it. If I didn\u2019t like what I heard I was ready to tweet out my displeasure, like Rosa Parks sitting on the back of the bus! He just laughed and told me that those ones wanted to be put in those positions and then leaned in close and whispered \u2018&lt;em&gt;they\u2019re lesbians&lt;/em&gt;\u2019. That made sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2018&lt;em&gt;I\u2019m sure you noticed the breast milk on tap in the cafeteria&lt;/em&gt;,\u2019 he jovially continued. \u2018&lt;em&gt;We harvest breast milk from employees here as well. They\u2019re paid double their salary for their vital contribution to the company&lt;/em&gt;.\u2019 Indeed, I had noticed the breast milk, but I had assumed they merely shipped it in. That they would harvest it on site was impressive and very progressive. \u2018&lt;em&gt;Zuckerberg implemented the idea after seeing Mad Max Fury Road in the Facebook theatre&lt;/em&gt;,\u2019 he went on. \u2018&lt;em&gt;We\u2019re still trying to work out some kinks in the system. Many employees are getting purposefully pregnant and having late-stage abortions after they start to produce milk. We\u2019re still trying to figure out how to fix this wasteful behavior, but we have a couple possible solutions for utilizing the fetal tissue which will be tested in the cafeteria here in Q1 2018&lt;/em&gt;.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d always been impressed by Facebook\u2019s corporate culture, but seeing the Harvesting Room and hearing about their progressive mindset REALLY impressed me. I was already 95% convinced that I wanted to work for Facebook and didn\u2019t think there was anything else I could see which could possibly make me 100% certain, but what I heard next DID IT. He closed the door and turned toward me with a grin. \u2018&lt;em&gt;Hey&lt;/em&gt;,\u2019 he chirped. \u2018&lt;em&gt;Want to see the dilation room?&lt;/em&gt;\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END ENTRY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Employment Approval Status: &lt;strong&gt;APPROVED&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Command?: **SEARCH APPLICANT +PEPPER_RODNEY**\n\n**SEARCHING**\n\n...  \n...\n\n**FILE FOUND**\n\nDisplay file?: **YES**  \n\\-----  \nApplicant: **Rodney Pepper**  \nGender: **Fluid**  \nSexuality: **Hydrosexual/Demilovato**  \nFacebook User: **Yes**  \nScan profile?: **YES**  \n\n**SCANNING...**  \n...  \n...  \n...  \n\n**SCAN COMPLETE**\n\nCommand?: **SEARCH PROFILE +JOURNAL AND/OR +DIARY**  \n\n**SEARCHING...**\n\n**+JOURNAL FOUND**\n\nOpen +JOURNAL?: **YES**  \n\\-----  \nJournal Date:  **October 13, 2017.**  \nJournal Entry: ...  \n...  \n...\n\nToday was a pretty exciting day.
