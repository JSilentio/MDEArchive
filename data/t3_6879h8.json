You can make claims of this, but without real evidence it could be argued that the show is simply attempting to be comedic and failing to your standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think comedy can easily be used for propaganda, look at the CIA supposedly having a Meme Team\u2122 to look into and engineer memes to effect the popular opinion. If I entertain conspiracy without any real fact backing it up, I could say a lot of things pumped out by the media are intentional propaganda pumped into the minds of the masses. But realistically, I think a lot of this can just be stupidity from the humans making the media, not a big plot to destroy civilization, but just the stupidity of humans being reflected in the art they make.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6879h8/what_is_the_line_of_comedy_and_propaganda/dgwy4yg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dgwy4yg", "created": 1493516036.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1493487236.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
