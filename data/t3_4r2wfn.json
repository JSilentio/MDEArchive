The priest faces the alter for the majority of the liturgy and only turns to give blessings etc. to those present in which you respond in Latin (considered sacred and less crude than the vernacular), he also will speak to the congregation during the sermon which (especially in SSPX) is often brutally redpilled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to this, the majority of Catholic churches have adopted what is called the &amp;quot;novus ordo&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;new order&amp;quot; which is a modernist banality (similar to the protestant mess you just attended) with only vague reference to the original, it is more directed towards the &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; with little focus or attention given to the sacrificial nature of the liturgy itself... this occurred in the 60&amp;#39;s and has been a disaster but that&amp;#39;s a story for another day. If you want real Christian mysticism, the kind of Catholicism that converted degenerates like Joris-Karl Huysmans and Oscar Wilde, then this is the place you need to be.
