My dad wasn&amp;#39;t perfect but he loved me and my mom, he was good to us. She just kept talking and I guess I freaked. I cocked my arm back and smashed her right in the nose, I thought it would be like in the movies with a small trickle of blood but blood went eveywhere. There was an audible sound like the one in your head when you eat a corn nut and my fist made her head rock back and hit the wall. We both just sat there stunned for a second and then she ran into the bathroom screaming and locked the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just stood there, motionless for a couple minutes, hearing her screams and sobs like they were a thousand miles away. And then I ran. I grabbed the car keys and left the front door wide open behind me. It was a stormy january night and the rain was torrential. I jumped into the car and keyed the ignition, I sat for a moment, then gunned it. The back roads of Oregon are amazing on a rain drenched night, it does wonders for the psyche. I fumbled through my glove box and found my prize, a last bit of sticky kush and my favorite pipe. With the Doors playing softly and the wipers whisking in a rythmic woosh woosh, woosh woosh, I smoke and feel at peace.

A church sits on its front with a decaying tilted steeple, I&amp;#39;ve seen it many times, as a man and a child, after all I was born and raised here. It always... haunted me as a youth and was the center of many horror stories by me and the other local children. As I pass it I feel a chill run up my spine, and can swear I get a whiff of dank earth, mold, rotten wood and thick moss. Its relaxing and chilling... As kids we would hover around its skirts, acting brave in front of the girls, them tittering and watching holding eachother from across the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would stand out in front, outside the molding picket fence, moss like tooth decay on the skeletal dental work. Me, Bixby, and Joe. Well, we used to stand out front until that day... We would stand out front and whisper under our breathes about the girls &amp;quot;Oh look at that one, in the red, she&amp;#39;s cute!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Nah man she&amp;#39;s a hogger, check out pigtails over there!&amp;quot; We would cast quick glances cooly in their direction, acting non chalant and casual, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re just 3 cool dudes chillen in front of a haunted church, what of it?&amp;quot; Our attitudes said. We would ride skateboards and drink sodas, sometimes we&amp;#39;d even venture up to the door.
