How did i know such a big secret at such a young age? well i was just begginning my 3rd life in the Sea Org, so that kind of knowledge was always obtainable to me at the blink of an eye. I spent my first life at the side of LRH and my 2nd pulling Tom into the Church, so my thetans were at full charge if u know what i mean. Anyways back to being 4 years old. I was preparing for my first day of kindergarten (which i obviously didnt need because i have a hundred years of learning) and i began to blow my earth parents minds. &amp;quot;Mom and Dad, i know about our privelege. Im going to make a change in this world.&amp;quot; They looked at me in awe and drove me to school quietly without another word. i was afraid the jig may be up, maybe they could sense my supreme intelligence. My parents dropped me off and I walked into the school for the first time. I shook the principals hand, making sure to stare him in the eye and squeeze harder than him to establish dominance. I quickly pointed out to the lack of minorities amongst his staff. The principal was my bitch, i had him right where i wanted him. The first school bell rang and the principal held the door open for me on the way out, after giving me a &amp;quot;go anywhere anytime&amp;quot; hallpass. I peered in at my class and i saw lots of brainless monkeys playing with blocks. This was not where i belonged, so i quickly moved on to the nearby 12th grade chemistry class. After sitting down with the rest of the students, the teacher looked at me and chuckled, &amp;quot;i think you&amp;#39;re in the wrong class&amp;quot;. without flinching, i challenged him to solve a complex  einsteinian equation faster then I could. The teacher accepted with cocky laughter. He was white after all. I beat him in a game of equations only using 5% of my full brain power and the teacher found himself embarrassed. I told him he could apologize by explaining to his class the opression he was teaching on a daily basis. he agreed. It was shortly after this interaction that i realized school wasnt the place for me so i asked the principal if he could drive me to get a bite to eat. He drove me to the local pizza joint and we shared two large pizzas. I slipped the waitress a note that said he was a pedophile that had kidnapped me. It wouldnt be long before the police arrived. after enjoying all of the two large pizzas i saw red and blue lights reflecting off the front window so i decided it was time to leave. i left out the backdoor but on the way out yelled &amp;quot;HE&amp;#39;S GOT A GUN!&amp;quot;. The police put down the threat swiftly. Talk about police brutality, they put 12 rounds through my principal on the first day of school. It was high noon and i still had 3 hours until my &amp;quot;parents&amp;quot; would expect me home. I stopped by the church get my new commission in this life, but they wouldnt scan my thetans unless i had $250. I walked to a bank across the street and pretended to be lost. the security guard took me into the backroom to call the police, but i karate chopped him in the neck, knocking him unconciouss before he could dial 911. I knew i would only have minutes before they found his limp body so i headed back to the safe. I had some safe cracking experience in my former lives, but the safe at this bank was something i had never seen, a triple bridge lock with ancillary deadbolts. It was time for me to tap into my super intelligence. I had to come up with a method for cracking into this safe and quick before i was found out. I attempted hundreds of permutatations of possible combinations within a minute, but thats when things went wrong.... &amp;quot;FREEZE&amp;quot; i turned around and two police officers were pointing guns at me from across the room. I had to think quick, so i pretended to have a gun of my own. The cops fired their guns at me but i outsmarted them, dodging the bullets like neo from the matrix. two of the bullets penetrated the lock mechanism and another two bullets ricocheted off of the safe, killing both officers instantly just as i had planned out. i spun open the lock on the safe and filled my backpack with cash.
