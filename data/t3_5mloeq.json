An animal follows their instincts by necessity, but humans seem to have the ability to deny and promote certain impulses entirely by their own will. For instance, we can choose to suppress our sex drive for a higher purpose, even if it&amp;#39;s our most powerful drive of all. Men have suppressed their instinct for survival since the beginning of time in the name of fighting for what&amp;#39;s right and to protect others. And you can&amp;#39;t say that this will is just another instinct. That would be like equating the pianist who decides which keys to press with the piano keys themselves. The keys are our instincts, the pianist the will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now when it comes to morality, moral law is like the sheet music that tells us the will which keys to press.
