The focus of Kierkegaard's work was not to autistically fit every theological question into neat little boxes and scientific distinctions. In fact he even criticized his contemporaries for trying to find logical arguments for the very existence of God, because he thought it was missing the point of faith entirely. Kierkegaard wanted to understand how to live as a Christian in truth, against the fake Christians of his age. And we avoid that question of how we should live by keeping our duties at arm's length.\n\n&gt;You say they are just myths and you pull the rug out from under God. There's no reason for him to literally exist anymore. It's essentially reducing Christianity to utilitarianism where you believe because it works.\n\nMyth does not mean not a true belief. It's a different type of knowledge from the knowledge that the big bang theory (theorized by a catholic priest and derided by atheists) would give us. We don't read genesis to understand how exactly to the detail God created the universe. We read Genesis to understand our place in the Universe, and our relation to God and to the Nature that he created. You're thinking from a 20th century fundamentalist mindset as if it's the entire history of Christianity and Judaism before it. To take the creation story as a grand myth does not mean that it is untrue in the same way that a Greek myth is untrue. Quite the opposite. \n\nI agree that believing in God and a literal resurrection is necessary for Christian faith.

The focus of Kierkegaard&amp;#39;s work was not to autistically fit every theological question into neat little boxes and scientific distinctions. In fact he even criticized his contemporaries for trying to find logical arguments for the very existence of God, because he thought it was missing the point of faith entirely. Kierkegaard wanted to understand how to live as a Christian in truth, against the fake Christians of his age.
