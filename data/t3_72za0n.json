Sees right through you, there is a chance he goes too far because hes smart as shit, so he accurately points out a flaw you have been insecure about and makes you really depressed before figuring out that he was right.

His bullying consists of insults that kids your age havent even heard of and often attempts at killing you, like that one time he threw a brick your way and missed by three centimeters. Always does it with a calm smile. Theres a rumour he picks up rats and takes em to his room. Probably kills and collets them.
