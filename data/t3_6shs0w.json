But the episode was pretty fantastic in the end and it was worth the watch. The episode perfectly encapsulates how the show explores existentialism. Rick voluntarily sacrifices his healthy state of mind, social connection and ultimately his humanity in order to explore an infinite potential of dimensions, and his mind purposely protects itself from fixing its problems because adventuring for him is an addiction. Or some shit, I&amp;#39;m glazed and being assaulted by fleas. So downvote this anyway you fuckin posers because at the end of the day, Sammy&amp;#39;s a crippled neanderthal running around Hollywood, Charls is riding his fucking makeshift raft out into the ocean to do his own fucking thing and Nick is living happy with his waifu selling old dressers in his hometown and there&amp;#39;s still a stockpile of prime tier footage sitting in some computer somewhere that someone isn&amp;#39;t editing for some excuse, and it&amp;#39;s all because it&amp;#39;s 2017 and there&amp;#39;s a culture war goin on.
