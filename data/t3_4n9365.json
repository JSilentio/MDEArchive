Basically everything from \"Approaching the front door\" to \"Sounds cool, I guess.\" is developing Linda's character (and it does a good job, ). Even the narration is seems to be from her point of view sometimes. The narrator is in 3rd person but certain adjectives seem like judgments from Linda's mind. For example: \"the *unfunny* jokes he told himself\", \"Joe's *unwanted* return\", \" her *ineffectual* husband\", \"*irksome* chuckle\".\n\nAlso the ironic statement \"his *loving* wife\" is like a judgment against Linda.

For example, maybe instead of Linda noticing how fat Joe is when he suggests to order pizza, instead we see Joe having a small panic attack after she says \"I'm just a bit tired, is all.\" where he becomes desperate to secure her affection and attempts to win her over by offering to buy pizza (a beta provider male character trait/flaw), and then when he reaches for the phone to call the pizza place, *Joe* see's the picture of himself when he wasn't fat, and then we get to see him decide to eat the pizza anyway, revealing his lack of self-control as another character flaw. I'm sure you can come up with other better examples. I think the ultimate goal is to show how Joe actually embraces the very flaws that illicit contempt from his wife, so that it's ultimately his fault that she treats him that way and not him being a victim.\n\nSorry for the long post but I thought you might like to hear what I thought.
