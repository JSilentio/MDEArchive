I have come to greatly admire the men who devote their entire lives to their faith. I think dedication is something that the modern man knows nothing of, outside of those who took anything seriously, things like academics, athletics, or really any realm of human achievement. The modern religious man is beset on all sides by those who aim to tear apart his beliefs, to remove it from the history. This is especially true for those who have devoted their lives to the religion, such as monks, nuns, and priests. These people are the reason Christianity is still one of the world's fastest growing religions today, especially in the global South.\n\nI have digressed from my original refutation of your fourth point, and no where did I specifically answer as to why metaphysics is an important piece of that larger puzzle, so let me try to focus on that specifically.
