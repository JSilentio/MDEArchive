I don't think that disqualifies his good traits at all. Its nothin serious, Im not advocating for his death, I just thought it was something funny and also something this sub would enjoy since we all (or at least a good majority) have strong counterculture/anti-pop culture opinions here.\n\nBut you are right, success-wise, he is ahead of 99% of us, me included. I just dislike his set up. You cant tell me that its not quite peculiar for a ~30 year old man to have a set up like that. It legitimately, to me, looks as if its like a shrine. Im sure he didn't create it with the intentions of it being shine or altar-like, but thats just how I see it, especially with the picture of batman in the middle.
