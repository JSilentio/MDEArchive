What I will say, is that racism, sexism, homophobia..... need to be called out, and racists, sexists and homophobes need to be called out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, this thread is about BANNING a TV show because of what some hack on an Internet clickbait spam site THINKS the show&amp;#39;s creator believes. Can you point out one &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;homophobic&amp;quot; segment on the show? If you are so concerned about racists, why isn&amp;#39;t anyone causing a stink &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/insider.foxnews.com/amp/article/52329?client=safari\"&gt;about this celebrity who publicly calls for the extinction of one race/sex?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, you do want to effectively ban opinions, by threatening to out/dox and ruin the livelihoods of people who hold opinions you simply disagree with/don&amp;#39;t understand so you mischaracterize what they are. And as demonstrated below, those opinions generally have little to do with race or homophobia, it&amp;#39;s just concepts you have trouble with. So you (the collective you) shout the most harmful, damaging label you can think of at the people who say it - &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;homophobe,&amp;quot; usually ignoring if the person saying it is gay or not white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contrary opinions are fine, if your opinion is that you want to live in a white supremacist america...... and you are a racist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not racist. You literally know nothing about me. This is exactly what I&amp;#39;m talking about. Being against mass immigration, either in Europe of the US, does not equal racism. You have no idea who I am, what I&amp;#39;ve done with my life, who my friends and family are. Talk about &amp;quot;straw man&amp;quot; arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5dhinh/the_battle_over_adult_swims_altright_tv_show_the/da5p0j9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_da5p0j9", "created": 1479510129.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1479481329.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "da57d37", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DelapidatedSagebrush", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_da5390m", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I never said anything about banning any ideas, so don't try and straw man your way out of this.
