In July 2015, they were found guilty of offences including rape and child prostitution over a period extending from 2006 to 2012. The child protection charity Barnardo's stated that it had worked with the two girls in 2008 and referred one of them to Buckinghamshire County Council as in danger of child sex exploitation. The council did not respond adequately and, following the convictions, apologised to the two girls for its failure to protect them.\n\n***\n\n**Banbury child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Banbury child sex abuse ring was a group of seven men who committed serious sexual offences against under-aged girls in the English town of Banbury, Oxfordshire. In March 2015, they were found guilty of offences including rape and sexual activity with a child over a period extending from 2009 to 2014. Police in Banbury had drawn on the lessons of Operation Bullfinch, which targeted sexual abuse in nearby Oxford.\n\n***\n\n**Bristol child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Bristol child sex abuse ring was a group of 13 Somali men who committed sexual offences against underage teenage girls in Bristol, in southwestern England. In November 2014, they were convicted of offences including rape, paying a child for sex, causing or inciting child prostitution, sexual acts with children and sex trafficking.\n\n***\n\n**Derby child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Derby child sex abuse ring was a group of men who sexually abused up to a hundred girls in Derby, England. In 2010, after an undercover investigation by Derbyshire police, members of the ring were charged with 75 offences relating to 26 girls. Nine of the 13 accused were convicted of grooming and raping girls between 12 and 18 years old. The attacks provoked fierce discussion about race and sexual exploitation.\n\n***\n\n**Halifax child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Halifax child sex abuse ring was a group of 15 British Asian men who committed serious sexual offences against two under-aged girls in the English town of Halifax and city of Bradford, West Yorkshire. In 2016, they were found guilty of rape and other forms of sexual abuse in several separate trials at Leeds Crown Court. In total, as many as a hundred men may have been involved in abusing the main victim. Twenty-five suspects were charged by West Yorkshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service and fifteen of these were found guilty.\n\n***\n\n**Keighley child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Keighley child sex abuse ring was a group of twelve muslim men who committed serious sexual offences against two under-aged white girls in the English town of Keighley and city of Bradford, West Yorkshire. In December 2015, they were found guilty of rape and other forms of sexual abuse by a unanimous jury verdict at Bradford Crown Court. They were sentenced in February 2016 to a total of 130 years in jail. The main victim, who had been targeted by ten of the men, was aged between 13 and 14 at the time of the attacks between 2011 and 2012.\n\n***\n\n**Oxford child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Oxford child sex abuse ring was a group of seven men who, in May 2013, were convicted of sexual offences including rape, conspiracy to commit rape, arranging or facilitating child prostitution, trafficking for sexual exploitation, and procuring a miscarriage. Their six underage victims were \"subjected to sexual violence marked out by its sadism: sexual assaults designed to draw blood, multiple rapes, [and] physical attacks in which [they were] choked\". The girls were mainly white and all the abusers were not, leading to renewed discussion as to whether the crimes were racially motivated and whether the initial failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racism.\n\nIn March 2015, a report revealed that more than 300 people, mostly girls from the city of Oxford, had been groomed and sexually exploited by such gangs in the area.\n\n***\n\n**Peterborough sex abuse case**\n\nThe Peterborough sex abuse case involved 10 men who committed sexual offences against under-aged girls, some as young as 12, in the English city of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. In a series of trials in 2014 and 2015, they were found guilty of rape, child prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation. The men were of Pakistani, Iraqi Kurdish, Czech and Slovak Roma heritage. Police had been alerted by the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases to the possibility of abuse taking place.\n\n***\n\n**Rochdale child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Rochdale child sex abuse ring involved under-age teenage girls in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England. Twelve men were convicted of sex trafficking and other offences including rape, trafficking girls for sex and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child, on 8 May 2012. Forty-seven girls were identified as victims of child sexual exploitation during the police investigation. The men were predominantly British Pakistanis which led to discussion on whether the failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racism.\n\n***\n\n**Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal**\n\nThe Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal has been described as the \"biggest child protection scandal in UK history\". From the late 1980s until the 2010s, organised child sexual abuse continued almost unchallenged in the northern English town of Rotherham, South Yorkshire. It was first documented in the early 1990s, when care-home managers investigated reports that children in their care were being picked up by taxi drivers. From at least 2001, multiple reports passed names of alleged perpetrators, several from one family, to the police and Rotherham Council.\n\n***\n\n**Telford child sex abuse ring**\n\nThe Telford child sex abuse ring was a group of seven men, mainly British Pakistanis who were found guilty of sexual offences against four teenage girls, aged 13 to 16. The offences occurred between 2007 and 2009 in Telford, England. In a series of trials stretching over two years to May 2013, they were convicted of offences including rape, controlling child prostitution, causing child prostitution and trafficking for the purpose of prostitution. A Channel 4 investigation into the sex gangs said local police had heard:\n\nappalling accounts about men who would ejaculate and then urinate in children's mouths, violating them in every orifice, as well as gang-rape by queues of men while girls were held hostage for hours, sometimes days \u2013 all the while being forced to listen to the screams of girls in other rooms with other men.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/milliondollarextreme/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aylesbury child sex abuse ring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Aylesbury child sex abuse ring was a group of six men of British Pakistani heritage who committed serious sexual offences against two under-aged girls in the English town of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.
