You don't say outright that being beautiful is the most important thing there is but SO much time is spent on looking pretty even before middle school. And when it isn't direct it is indirect when boys get to do cool boyscout stuff and play around all crazy but if you're a girl then your mom or dad will tell you that you have to act more lady like. And then you are spending hours and a lot of money to make sure to get rid of any hair and cover any blemishes and paint on your face because you would be a lazy slob not to and being beautiful and attractive to men is simply very important. And marriage is a fairytale and everywhere a beautiful woman on the arm of a man is so romanticized and imortant. Every girl values it and enforces it into each other because you learn it and see it everywhere forever. Most every woman feels this way and passes it on to her daughter. It is just normalized. A lot of self worth goes into trying to look the best and it generally won't feel like enough and that's the worst. Men aren't the ones implementing it but they share the feelings that women should be beautiful and it is valued and that makes some girls upset. It's a validation they've been told they need from early on and they can try or not try but they'll be mad about it being there (because it sucks). It's possible to figure out self worth without quite all the effort but it takes some rewiring and some women just think that it makes more sense to be mad and don't see any solution really. People think other people care more than they do, it's best to just change and not make a huge fuss about it. Of course you get judging looks if your face is bare and not particularly pretty or if you don't shave your underarms, and men don't have to deal with those expectations but will negatively notice the women who don't do those things. So it rather sucks but it's not the end of the world. Dad bod beer gut doesn't look as bad as a woman with a gut. You just get judged more harshly. Seen as more gross. \n\n\nMen do speak with eachother with more attention and respect than with women and I think that women just need to get over that. It's not changing. Women speak to other women differently as well. Natural man speak just happens to be the best for problem solving and war and business etc. man stuff. It only sucks when the same content is valued less because of the preconceived notion that women are not as good at stuff \n\nRape culture was more prevalent before but I think all of the attention fixed it pretty well. That being said I am a 20 year old girl and I and all of my close friends have been taken advantage of. It's not a culture but it happens and it's no fun. Kind of beside the point. I do think that catcalling is viewed as a part of a culture just because it's very scary and uncomfortable and easy to blow up. That stuff just doesn't happen as much anymore. Which is good. \n\n\n\nWomen who make a huge deal out of that kind of shit are in the wrong and they think that making a big deal out of small problems is so important and it is what will make them strong and free and etc etc. it just gives more anxiety. A lot of women are just searching for examples to feel bad for themselves because they think that victimizing is the way to feel good about themselves. I do not get it. I think that things aren't so bad. There are good things about being a girl. You get to be more emotionally open and sometimes more openly artistic and cops don't give you tickets if you are cute. Being a girl SUCKS if you aren't good looking though. Makes things much more difficult. Of course it's not easy for anyone who isn't good looking but ugly men still land high paying jobs pretty easily and other men don't judge them for it. No one likes you if you are an ugly girl! \n\n\n\n\nIt amazes me that women really complain about this, even girls in my own life. My closest girlfriends agree that we don't feel opressed and we wish that those girls would just stop. \n\nThat is my explanation, sorry for length. \n\nBut I do think that when you see some men saying that women are weak that girls will source that thinking from some higher population of men than just the individual that says it.\n\nI think/hope the problem will go away. Everyone has been very tired of it. \n\nSee why girls aren't good with men with business stuff? Men don't want to hear all of this crap but women love it. We just like to talk talk talk.

No one likes you if you are an ugly girl! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It amazes me that women really complain about this, even girls in my own life. My closest girlfriends agree that we don&amp;#39;t feel opressed and we wish that those girls would just stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is my explanation, sorry for length. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do think that when you see some men saying that women are weak that girls will source that thinking from some higher population of men than just the individual that says it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think/hope the problem will go away. Everyone has been very tired of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See why girls aren&amp;#39;t good with men with business stuff? Men don&amp;#39;t want to hear all of this crap but women love it. We just like to talk talk talk. Men are more 1.2.3. again I&amp;#39;m sorry for length but I am not concerned enough to try to cut it down.
