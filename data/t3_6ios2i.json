The thing that made the Jewish people foolish was not their genetic make up but their culture, which often centered and still often centers around materialistic pursuits. This is why Jews today who have a strong sense of family and culture often become successful in any area they choose. They placed so much importance on money that they couldn't handle the fact that their messiah wasn't rich and didn't come from money, because they were promised a king. Jesus *was* a king but not in the sense that they thought he was.\n\n&gt;What Christian prophecies are there that have come true?\n\nProphecies that come from the mouths of men are not to be trusted. They are not Christian prophecies just because the person making them are Christian and were given pope status. The only prophecies are those of the book of revelations and those of the words of Jesus and the Bible. \n\n\"But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. **People will be lovers of themselves**, **lovers of money**, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, **without self-control**, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, **lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God**\u2014 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. \n\nThey are the kind who worm their way into homes and **gain control over gullible women**, **who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires**, always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.\" - 2 Timothy 3\n\nNow we have all of these \"love yourself\" movements, and movements that focus solely on pleasure, like the sexual revolution. Don't you see it? It's happening and these acceptance movements are only going to get worse. \n\nIf you care to read revelations a lot of the less metaphorical and less symbolic stuff they say will happen is now in the realm of possibility (like it never has been before) and some of the powers that be are pushing it. Total control is something a government can have now, forever if they really want it, and the people won't be able to fight back - that has never happened before. The bible talks about that. Not being able to buy or sell with some form of identification is talked about in the bible - and now there are these things called credit cards that are basically a must have if you don't want to be homeless. That is just one of the many \"brands\" or \"marks\" that the government will place on the common man. \n\nThe mark of the beast will hopefully be the most obvious mark and prophecy that we see come true. People will be forced to pledge allegiance to the antichrist, who will probably be a figurehead of a world government. If you do not do this you will starve, choose to starve or choose to fight back and show your allegiance to Christ in some way - if in the event that this does happen.\n\nThere are more symbolic passages in revelations and other parts of the New Testament that strongly suggest there will be a union of nations before Christ's return, sort of like the EU. Possibly the EU might become something even more evil. We have to wait and see. \n\n&gt;Whenever I do feel something \"divine\" I still ultimately know it's just neurotransmitters in my head, even if it is a useful mental model to perceive this as God, or as some real entity.\n\nBut if humans were designed by God, and we live in a physical world, why wouldn't he put some means of feeling divinity in our brains? Think of the brain like an antennae for the world around us, something that was given to us so we could experience things. Why wouldn't the experience of God produce a physical event in the brain? It's in all of us for a reason. What survival use would feelings of divinity have for a hunter and gatherer, for a \"hairless ape\"?\n\n&gt;My inner racist atheist always comes back when I look at Christianity and tells me \"you couldn't earnestly worship a kikecicle, you'll just end up laughing your head off one day in church\".\n\nJesus disavowed his people and they disavowed him. Jews aren't the \"chosen ones\". He was the perfect man not because of his genetic make up but because of his beliefs that he spread to the world, beliefs that he didn't only preach but followed. Again you're looking at Jesus as a flesh person and not as the holy being he was. \n\nI suggest you read the new testament but even if you don't and even if you defile the name of God he will forgive you. There are multiple instances in the bible where people are forgiven multiple times for their actions against God, because God understands what it's like to be human and to have doubt and everything. God knows what set of circumstances contribute to your misdeeds and what misdeeds are done out of true malevolence, etc. Most people don't understand the act of God giving his only son to the world and leaving him to suffer for days on end, and my I've been told by fathers that it's something you really don't understand until you have a kid. God didn't have to give his son to the world, but he loved his creation so much that he did. He loved his creation so much he put part of himself into it to suffer, just like an artist who suffers through his work, because he loves his work, like God loves the Earth and the rest of the universe that he has created.\n\nAnd like always there's an element of \"faith\", that's our part of the bargain. We have to put trust that the being who put us here has not left us, and continues to guide his creation, the play he created for us. \n\nPeople always ask, \"why not just put us in heaven right away\" etc. etc. It's not that simple. If all you knew was good, it wouldn't be good because for there to be good there needs to be bad. So we go through life experiencing the good and the bad, so we have a greater appreciation for all God can give us.

Have nothing to do with such people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are the kind who worm their way into homes and &lt;strong&gt;gain control over gullible women&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires&lt;/strong&gt;, always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.&amp;quot; - 2 Timothy 3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have all of these &amp;quot;love yourself&amp;quot; movements, and movements that focus solely on pleasure, like the sexual revolution. Don&amp;#39;t you see it? It&amp;#39;s happening and these acceptance movements are only going to get worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you care to read revelations a lot of the less metaphorical and less symbolic stuff they say will happen is now in the realm of possibility (like it never has been before) and some of the powers that be are pushing it. Total control is something a government can have now, forever if they really want it, and the people won&amp;#39;t be able to fight back - that has never happened before. The bible talks about that. Not being able to buy or sell with some form of identification is talked about in the bible - and now there are these things called credit cards that are basically a must have if you don&amp;#39;t want to be homeless. That is just one of the many &amp;quot;brands&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;marks&amp;quot; that the government will place on the common man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mark of the beast will hopefully be the most obvious mark and prophecy that we see come true. People will be forced to pledge allegiance to the antichrist, who will probably be a figurehead of a world government. If you do not do this you will starve, choose to starve or choose to fight back and show your allegiance to Christ in some way - if in the event that this does happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are more symbolic passages in revelations and other parts of the New Testament that strongly suggest there will be a union of nations before Christ&amp;#39;s return, sort of like the EU. Possibly the EU might become something even more evil. We have to wait and see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever I do feel something &amp;quot;divine&amp;quot; I still ultimately know it&amp;#39;s just neurotransmitters in my head, even if it is a useful mental model to perceive this as God, or as some real entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if humans were designed by God, and we live in a physical world, why wouldn&amp;#39;t he put some means of feeling divinity in our brains? Think of the brain like an antennae for the world around us, something that was given to us so we could experience things. Why wouldn&amp;#39;t the experience of God produce a physical event in the brain? It&amp;#39;s in all of us for a reason. What survival use would feelings of divinity have for a hunter and gatherer, for a &amp;quot;hairless ape&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My inner racist atheist always comes back when I look at Christianity and tells me &amp;quot;you couldn&amp;#39;t earnestly worship a kikecicle, you&amp;#39;ll just end up laughing your head off one day in church&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus disavowed his people and they disavowed him. Jews aren&amp;#39;t the &amp;quot;chosen ones&amp;quot;. He was the perfect man not because of his genetic make up but because of his beliefs that he spread to the world, beliefs that he didn&amp;#39;t only preach but followed. Again you&amp;#39;re looking at Jesus as a flesh person and not as the holy being he was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest you read the new testament but even if you don&amp;#39;t and even if you defile the name of God he will forgive you. There are multiple instances in the bible where people are forgiven multiple times for their actions against God, because God understands what it&amp;#39;s like to be human and to have doubt and everything. God knows what set of circumstances contribute to your misdeeds and what misdeeds are done out of true malevolence, etc. Most people don&amp;#39;t understand the act of God giving his only son to the world and leaving him to suffer for days on end, and my I&amp;#39;ve been told by fathers that it&amp;#39;s something you really don&amp;#39;t understand until you have a kid. God didn&amp;#39;t have to give his son to the world, but he loved his creation so much that he did. He loved his creation so much he put part of himself into it to suffer, just like an artist who suffers through his work, because he loves his work, like God loves the Earth and the rest of the universe that he has created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like always there&amp;#39;s an element of &amp;quot;faith&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s our part of the bargain. We have to put trust that the being who put us here has not left us, and continues to guide his creation, the play he created for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People always ask, &amp;quot;why not just put us in heaven right away&amp;quot; etc. etc. It&amp;#39;s not that simple. If all you knew was good, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be good because for there to be good there needs to be bad. So we go through life experiencing the good and the bad, so we have a greater appreciation for all God can give us. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6ios2i/i_stopped_believing_in_god/dj8lpmj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dj8lpmj", "created": 1498144503.0, "author_flair_text": "READ UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO", "created_utc": 1498115703.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ios2i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ios2i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dj9hvm6", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pirozhki", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_dj9fb38", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Please do not be mean to me.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please do not be mean to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6ios2i/i_stopped_believing_in_god/dj9hvm6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dj9hvm6", "created": 1498189806.0, "author_flair_text": "Vanilla Gorilla / Honda Civic Nationalist", "created_utc": 1498161006.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dj9fb38", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dj8kg4o", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;Whenever I do feel something \"divine\" I still ultimately know it's just neurotransmitters in my head, even if it is a useful mental model to perceive this as God, or as some real entity.\n\n&gt;My inner racist atheist always comes back when I look at Christianity and tells me \"you couldn't earnestly worship a kikecicle, you'll just end up laughing your head off one day in church\".\n\nLet me tell ya guy, I have a mental image of what you look like in real life and it's not pretty.\n\nHow much time to you spend a day at a desk jerking off your neurotransmitters with masturbatory nihilistic garbage online?
