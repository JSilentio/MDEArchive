Jesus did not fight against the thief or the whore, but saw them as people led down a corrupt path. His fight was against the Pharisees, the same people who devised the orthodox Judaism that you see, but might not know, today. When you look at Jesus's life from an objective perspective, you can see that he lives primarily as a reformer. When he says, 'follow me and you will be cleansed of sin', he is not talking about being baptized or participating in some ritual, he is saying to embrace his teaching on life to become the 'Ideal Man' that is also glorified in classical Grecian philosophy as well as Renaissance philosophy.\n\nSo based off that I guess you could say I'm a 'Secular Christian' although it's more complicated than that.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not worship anything or anyone, but I&amp;#39;m humble enough to say &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;#39; unlike the average fedora-clad atheist.

Jesus did not fight against the thief or the whore, but saw them as people led down a corrupt path.
