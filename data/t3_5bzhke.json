Say hello, Percy.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Percy was an adorable shota -- a bright, innocent boy of 14 with a bright, innocent body. There were no burns on his arms and legs, no bruises on his knees. He was, to the the eye of the connoisseur,  a virgin. And the room was full of connoisseurs. \u201cHello mommy,\u201d he said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hillary snorted, wiping the mucus from the corner of her mouth with her left bubonic paw. \u201cBring him here,\u201d she said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eichenwald, as usual, obeyed. The boy stood before the woman who would be king, his brown eyes  wide and watery. His mouth was open, but awkwardness betrayed his tongue. He\u2019d been trained, she knew, in the finest shota schools -- his rude dick was ready to satisfy lewd grown women, and his rude mind had been narrowed to the meanness of pure desire by the sphere of endless televisions used to bathe his uncolored body with the necessary degenerating radiation.

She clawed at his eyes, pulling fingernail sized scoops out of his vitreous humor and then flicking them away, with contemptuous distaste, onto the mahogany floor.
