I guess it's somewhat the logical conclusion of a \"race doesn't matter\" stance as well as a stance of strict individualism and humanitarianism though, even if more than half of said conclusions are not intrinsically \"needed\" to lessen harm and improve the world from a progressive perspective, and we don't even need to talk about the \"tolerance of the intolerant\" neurosis going on regarding conservative Islam that is internally inconsistent and probably the most glaring flaw of political correctness.\n\nI'm all for ending needless bigotry in a vacuum, and I'd say I support equality under the law, but the way this shit is being implemented in Europe is fucking appalling. It leads to a selectively empathetic \"beggars can't be choosers\" stance in me due to the context and situation we're in, and the selective empathy is almost a coping mechanism in fact, because honestly I don't want to have to hypothetically advocate evicting anyone because of their race.
