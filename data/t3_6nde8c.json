Can anyone else not stomach (see what I did there?) this zeitgeist of bingeshitting? I throw up sometimes just thinking about it, which ruins my chances of even doing it. I can&amp;#39;t get through more than 4, maybe 5 days of not pooping, but I&amp;#39;m told that the real way to do it is to hold everything in for at least a week, because then you can just spend three or four hours of pure bliss pooping everything out. I just can&amp;#39;t do it but the rest of the world seems obsessed with &amp;quot;willful constipation&amp;quot; and bragging about how many days they hold it in and how good it feels and smells when the poop finally comes out. A guy I work with said he held it in for three weeks once (he&amp;#39;s probably exaggerating but not by much) and then deliberately refused to flush the toilet at all until he got everything out of his system all at once so the toilet bowl was overflowing with poop. Of course then the toilet clogged when he tried to flush it, but he says the plumber was just so in awe of what he had done that he didn&amp;#39;t even charge him for unclogging. I like taking a massive shit as much as the next guy and think there is a true artform to it, and when I haven&amp;#39;t been able to go to the bathroom for a while then I do get a thrill in anticipation knowing that the next shit is going to be a big one, but it can&amp;#39;t be good to wait a whole week or more just so you can spend all afternoon on the shitter moaning as ten-day-old corn and beef finally gets purged from your body. You could even see it as some kind of pull to be as disgusting as possible or something. I mean I know it&amp;#39;s just a natural bodily function, but am I alone in thinking that all of this is a little... disgusting? I&amp;#39;m all for people using their free time pursuing hobbies, their own artistic endeavors, refined life skills, any of that, and excrement has been used in fine art before, but I think turning such a natural process into a big deal that you tell everyone about constantly and have your whole life revolve around (counting down the days until you let yourself shit, trying to go for a new record each time), strikes me as a bit much. Just enjoy your normal shits and there will be times every now and then when you take a shit and it feels particularly good. Isn&amp;#39;t that enough? Why do people need to try and orchestrate reality so that they can have these insanely massive bowel movements? I have fun memories just of normal shits that I&amp;#39;ve had, I don&amp;#39;t need to go for a new high score everytime or try to have an orgasm while taking a shit that lasts two or three hours because I&amp;#39;m so backed up. Taking a shit can be a gratifying experience but &amp;quot;bingeshitting&amp;quot; is taking things too far. You could even make an argument that it reduces the value you get out of the shit because your goal is to shit as much as you can rather than focus more on the quality of the shit itself. I don&amp;#39;t know maybe I have some disorder or something, I&amp;#39;ve tried but can&amp;#39;t go more than half a week or so without needing to shit, and then the experience is pretty good but not good enough and I don&amp;#39;t have it in me to try harder to hold it in next time.
