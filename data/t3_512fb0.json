For the first year he was so sweet, like he used to call me his princess and stuff, some people find that stuff all icky but it used to make me feel so special.\n\nWe were going strong, and after around half a year we started talking about kids and marriage (this was back in 2015 and at the time I was 19 and he was 22) - we met at Uni. That type of talk used to make me feel so warm, I just knew that this guy was the right one for me, he was SO kind and I felt like he really wanted a future with me.\n\nAnyway we decided to try for a baby around summer 2015, we checked if we were both able, as his father had troubles with his mother (getting her pregnant...). But he was totally able. I found out I was pregnant  August 14th 2015, I was around 3 weeks gone. After that we'd been to lots of parent to be meetings, bought the books, we did everything, and we'd had a scan November. \n\nThis is when it changed, he was a total nerd and I used to tease him about it, secretly I loved how he was such a geek. But he used to watch this totally mythed YouTube channel called Million-Dollar-Extreme, and the stuff he used to watch on there was so disturbing. It was really racist stuff about killing (jews and african americans etc). He showed me their videos occasionally expecting me to laugh, but I was appalled. These guys even have a show on Adult Swim at the moment... We got in big arguments about it, it's almost like he became a different man. I know for sure that it was this internet community that changed him, he used to talk on Skype with other people who were a member of the community and the way they spoke made me feel sick, but I loved him so I guess I sort of just blocked it out. It was around this time when his whole attitude changed to me, he spoke to me like trash, made me feel worthless, the times of princess and cuddles were over. I know that this YouTube channel changed him, I mean how on earth could some guys on the internet mean more to my boyfriend than me and his unborn baby did.\n\nAround February this year, he told me over dinner that he wasn't sure he was ready for a child. I broke down right there, how could he do that to me? Dropping such a bombshell when I was already pregnant. I won't get into the details, but he pressured me into getting an abortion 5 months into the pregnancy. Our relationship was dead after this, but I stayed with him because he made me feel like I had no other choice, he made me feel like I couldn't get anyone else because he used to comment that I was fat ever since I got pregnant, that I got more wrinkles and that I looked ugly without makeup on. I never told my parents, it's not like they'd have cared anyway.\n\nEarlier this year, I got talking to an old friend from high school, he used to have a crush on me I think. We ran into each other briefly when I was out with my girlfriends and he messaged me the day after on facebook. We hit it off again (totally platonic i would never be unfaithful) and we started talking a lot, I kept it a secret from my boyfriend, I was scared how he'd react. Like I said me and this guy we were only friends and we never spoke about anything sexual. My boyfriend had never hit me but the recent weeks, he had been close to during arguments.\n\nI eventually ended up confiding in my friend, he was so understanding and made me feel so happy. He was there for me emotionally now that my boyfriend wasn't. After a month or so of us two talking, my boyfriend had got into my facebook (i dont know how) and saw the messages between me and my friend. He flipped, I'd never seen him like it before. He kept screaming at me \"You better hyde you fucking bitch\" \"You are a disgusting whore how can you do this to me\". and he spat in my face. That same night, he beat me up on my stomach(i guess so nobody could tell...) and long story short, he raped me. The week after, I'd packed my stuff and moved back in with my parents. I haven't told anyone, not even the police or my parents. I'm so afraid too, he has messaged me many times the past month or two, saying he wants me back and he's so sorry. I'm so stupid, because I've been considering it.\n\nI'm so unsure on what to do, I feel violated and pathetic. I need some help, I hope this is the right place to ask for it...\n\n\ni am the author HELLO.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been with him going 1 and a bit years this summer.
