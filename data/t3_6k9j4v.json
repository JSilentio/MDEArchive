Once, in a prior civilization, records suggest that a third of the class fell and the strongest, and thereby leader of those fallen, was called \"Lucifer\" (or Satan). Even today they occupy the near heavens as what humans refer to as \"space aliens.\" They also burrow in bases underground and participate in genetic manipulation and hybridization with humans, and attempt to recruit (while remaining among the \"unseen\") those humans with souls who are unstable or weak in their pursuit of the true Kingdom of Heaven. These \"Luciferians\" (for the most part from the \"unseen\" world) started all religions and masquerade as \"gods\" to humans. They offer to humans (who are unknowingly praying to them) whatever material gains they desire. These \"Luciferians\" and their devotees preach \"Heaven on Earth,\" \"Peace among men,\" and a long and healthy life in the human condition, and are determined to take the steps to make the inhabitants of the planet subservient to their \"ideal\" mammalian ethic - destructive to the natural evolutionary processes, and abhorrent to the Kingdom Level Above Human. These \"fallen angels\" unknowingly also SERVE the Next Level -- for as the aspirants to the Level Above Human apply the necessary effort to rise above \"this world\" -- they gain the strength to enter the \"Next World.\"\n17.\nWhere the space aliens have a major stronghold in playing \"God\" is through those humans with the most power. The power is the strongest among the very rich and the very righteous (their self-styled religion) who accept that it is their (\"God-given\") responsibility to maintain the world's stability - judged, of course, by whatever actions are necessary to maintain and increase that power. These powerful individuals have a loose-knit world-wide \"club\" that for the most part dictates who their primary \"monopoly\" players are - those leaders in the \"significant\" or strong societies or cultures. Government leaders, the very rich, and the world's righteous or \"moral\" leaders, need each other to accomplish their desired ends. They together really determine what is \"right\" and \"wrong\" for the populace as a whole, for they trust their overview (and needless to say, it is motivated, for it makes the rich richer, the political more powerful, while offering sufficient \"moral consciousness\" to nurture a guiltless society). This \"morality call\" translates down to every level of society's structure, i.e., its laws, its permissiveness, and its intolerance. The governments' law enforcers see to it that nothing is permitted to significantly threaten the rules of the \"big bedfellows\" morality - which is no morality at all, but the long list of do's and don'ts which protect the money flow, secure the power players, and sustain the acceptable morality code. Any little group that isn't naively, totally submissive to their social rules, or begins to see through this \"control mechanism,\" or questions its rightness, is seen as subversive, radical, anti-social, a cult, or even treasonous - or potentially \"terrorists.\"\n18.\nIt is a fact of record that a number of space alien groups or \"races\" have related to humans as recently as the past few decades for various reasons. These ranged from \"deals\" of mutual benefit - trading spacecraft technology for uninterrupted genetic experimentation - to missions of \"spiritual enlightenment.\" All of these activities are far beneath Next Level interests or activity and are, in fact, diversionary efforts of the space aliens to have humans look to them at a time that our return presence was imminent.\n19.\nThe space aliens have very successfully, through their religions, totally confused the humans' concept of \"God\" or \"Deity.\" (These religions were begun as major distortions immediately following any visitation of the Next Level.) The Next Level abhors religions, for they bind humans more thoroughly to the human kingdom, using strong misinformation mixed with cosmic or universal consciousness of Creation, about which, in truth, they know nothing. Some of their Christians say that God was incarnate as Jesus - though He knew that His Father was clearly a separate entity, even when His Father's mind was in Him. Luciferians now answer the Christians' (as well as all other religions') prayers or requests as they promote enriching their human lives and having them seek a \"Heaven on Earth\" and a type of Second Coming that would clearly be abominable to the Next Level. Only the Luciferians could have Christians believing that Jesus promoted family values, becoming better humans, establishing professional religious institutions, and looking for the Second Coming of some flowing-robed, peace-and-love manifestation of their artists' conceptions.\nMost religious think of a Kingdom of God, though it doesn't register to them that that Kingdom has many members. They feel that if you acknowledge \"many members\" in the Kingdom of God, then you would be acknowledging a pantheism. Any time any member of the Next Level is assigned a task to relate to humans directly, since he is of the Kingdom of God, he is rightfully \"God\" to them, for he is the member of the Evolutionary Level Above Human (\"Kingdom of God\") who is relating to them. This is not to say that there is not in the Next Level a \"Chief of Chiefs\" or one who is Supreme. Luciferians have had humans spiritualize and elevate that spiritual feeling for the word \"God\" so that no member of the Next Level would want to identify as one of those members of the Kingdom of God. The irony is that humans pray to the masquerading \"gods\" - space aliens - who have many \"superior\" beings in their different races and subraces. So, humans are unknowingly praying to different \"gods\" of many \"gods.\" Of course, none of these are, in fact, \"Gods\" - other than self-appointed. (They are simply humanoid remnants from previous civilizations that are allowed to exist as a part of the balance of positive and negative presences, and allowing a full range of free-will options.)\nThe Next Level is not into rituals, or spiritual inflation of stature, though it's true that younger members learn to be respectful and acknowledge the wisdom and serviceability of Older Members in the Next Level. Where one can fall from progressing in the Next Level is to slip into believing that he can grow on his own. The only way an individual can grow in the Next Level is to learn to be dependent on his Older Member as that source of unlimited growth and knowledge. So, any younger member in good standing, forever remains totally dependent upon (and looks to) his Older Member for all things.\n20.\nSince this is the close of the Age, the battle in the Heavens with their servants on Earth will be the means of that closing and the spading under of the plants (including the humans) of this civilization. \"Weeds\" are now getting rid of weeds - from gang wars to nations involved in ethnic cleansing. This is simply a part of the natural recycling process which precedes a restoration period of the planet in preparation for another civilization's beginning.\n21.\nIf you connect with this information - if you attempt to connect with us in your desire to leave your humanness behind and link with the Evolutionary Level Above Human - you may encounter what seems to be insurmountable tests. You can imagine the \"fallout\" of your separation. You may even be faced with the possibility of losing the body you are \"wearing\" in the demonstration of your faithfulness. We can take you through all of these trials - they are designed to offer you strength and resolve.\n22.\nIf you expect to go with us in our spacecrafts headed for our \"world\" and the only true Kingdom Level Above Human, you will likely have to physically engage in preparedness and readiness for that departure. That readiness should not be interfered with by the servants of this world.\nI find it all but impossible to present these truths to you in a way that might stand a chance to survive the avalanche of thoughts from the opposition that would do anything in their power to prevent your separation from their world and your physical life in it. I hope that my Older Member's mercy will give you strength. If you care to speak to me in your thoughts, I answer to \"Do\" (pronounced Doe). The name itself means nothing, but I connect with it for it was agreed upon for my usage by my Older Member \"Ti\" (pronounced Tee). Ti stayed with me, setting an example and preparing me for this present responsibility until 1985, and then separated from her borrowed human container and returned to the Next Level. (If we're not mistaken, our entire classroom task here from 1975 until the present has only been about 30 minutes by Next Level reckoning.)\nIf you have grown to hate your life in this world and would lose it for the sake of the Next Level, you will find true life with us - potentially forever.

They were in varying stages of metamorphic transition from membership in the human kingdom to membership in the physical Evolutionary Level Above Human (what your history refers to as the Kingdom of God or Kingdom of Heaven).\n3.\nIt seems that we arrived in Earth's atmosphere between Earth's 1940's and early 1990's. We suspect that many of us arrived in staged spacecraft (UFO) crashes and many of our discarded bodies (genderless, not belonging to the human species), were retrieved by human authorities (government and military).\n4.\nOther crews from the Level Above Human preceded our arrival and \"tagged\" - placed a deposit \"chip\" - in each of the vehicles (bodies) that we would individually incarnate into, when that instruction would be given. These \"chips\" set aside those bodies for us.\n5.\nWe feel that while we were \"out of body\" between arrival and incarnation, we were thoroughly briefed and were taken through an extensive preview of places and events that would assist our individual incarnation process of bringing our mind - our consciousness - into the vehicle (body) and overriding the mind of the human \"plant\" (or container) that each of us was to use. This incarnation process is very difficult and cannot be done without the help of Older Members of the Evolutionary Level Above Human who have not only gone through the metamorphic transition to completion themselves, but who have also assisted others through this transition before (acting as \"midwives\" for some in the shedding of their human-creature characteristics while preparing to be born as new creatures into the Next Evolutionary Kingdom).\n6.\nThe true Kingdom of God - the real physical Kingdom of Heaven - the Evolutionary Level Above Human - are completely synonymous. As a genderless Kingdom, it \"reproduces\" or adds to its Kingdom membership through the use of this metamorphic process. This Next Level Kingdom created all that is - including all the paths that lead to decay and destruction, for the creatures it creates are created with free will - an ever-present option to choose the direction to take at any juncture or moment of decision.\n7.\nThe metamorphic \"birth\" into the Level Above Human occurs as follows: In any given civilization on a fertile planet such as Earth (and Earth has had many periodic/cyclical civilizations), the Level Above Human plants all the new life forms (including humans) for that civilization in a neutral condition so that they have a chance to choose the direction of their growth. The Level Above Human - or Next Level - directly (hands on) relates significantly to the civilization at its beginning stage, and subsequently (with few exceptions) at approximately 2000-year intervals (48-hour intervals from a Next Level perspective) until that civilization's final \"Age.\"\n8.\nEach time the Next Level relates directly to any portion of that civilization, \"deposits\" containing \"souls\" (the \"seed\" or \"chip\" with a program of metamorphic possibilities) are placed in many human plants. This deposit is potentially the \"gift of life\" into the physical and real Evolutionary Level Above Human. These deposits are given or made only when members of the Level Above Human are assigned to directly relate to (be incarnate in) the civilization. Only these Representatives can \"nurture\" those deposited souls with Next Level thinking, behavior, and all the information required to effectively \"fluff off\" all human/mammalian characteristics of the old creature. (A potential creature of the Next Level cannot cling to human ways any more than a butterfly can cling to caterpillar ways.) So, when a Representative from that Kingdom is present - that \"Rep's\" nurturing (teaching) is a \"window\" for exiting the human kingdom for all who have been given deposits/souls. These deposits are made only in vehicles (bodies) that are \"old enough\" - having grown or matured enough - for self-determination or responsibility.\n9.\nHumans with deposits containing souls can likely be identified at this time as some of those who are rapidly losing respect for this world or its \"system.\" They are, from the establishment's point of view, being irresponsible or anti-social - and will be seen by the world as duped, crazy, a cult member, a drifter, a loner, a drop-out, a separatist, etc.\n10.\nNot only is the body, in a sense, the temporary container for the soul, but even more importantly - the soul is the housing or container of the new creature. The soul has its own \"brain\" or \"hard drive\" that accumulates only information of the Next Level - mundane as well as theoretical or philosophical. The soul also becomes part of the new physical body of the new creature, though it is seldom seen by human eyes. Therefore, when a soul is a part of a new deposit, it has very little information and is as a very small Next Level \"fetus.\" As it develops or grows in size, it necessitates the abortion of the human mind, which is in a container beside it. If you think of a glass vase that has two balloons in it, one balloon is the human mind, the other is the Next Level mind. When the Next Level makes a \"soul deposit,\" it is like placing the second balloon in the glass vase. So, when metamorphosis begins, the human mind (balloon) is all but filling the container, and the Next Level mind or soul is all but empty. As the Next Level mind increases - and the soul begins to grow larger - the human-mind container or balloon decreases until, if the Next Level mind successfully makes it to \"term,\" the human deflated balloon is discarded and the Next Level balloon (with Next Level mind) is all that fills the container, or glass vase. That soul with its Next Level mind has by then become a physical body in a new species (the Level Above Human), needing only a new physical outer shell, which it receives as a \"quartermaster issue\" upon physically entering the Next Level.\nThe final act of metamorphosis or separation from the human kingdom is the \"disconnect\" or separation from the human physical container or body in order to be released from the human environment and enter the \"next\" world or physical environment of the Next Level. This will be done under the supervision of Members of the Next Level in a clinical procedure. We will rendezvous in the \"clouds\" (a giant mothership) for our briefing and journey to the Kingdom of the Literal Heavens.\n11.\nMetamorphosis is not ordinarily accomplishable during only one period of visitation from the Level Above Human. Therefore, the deposit task at each visitation includes deposits with \"programs\" for returnees who are still in \"forward motion.\"\n12.\nAt the end of the Age or civilization (where we are now), it seems thatall souls that were deposited in any part of the present civilization are brought back. Between visitations, \"faithful\" souls are \"put on ice,\" so to speak - in the keeping of the Level Above Human, to be re-deposited and again incarnated during the next visitation. So, at this time we have both \"faithful\" souls who might be in the third \"trimester\" of their metamorphosis preparing for the final test before \"emerging\" in their new physical body belonging to the Next Level, and we also have all those souls who have \"fallen away\" during this civilization's visitations. Even they now have a chance at reinstatement.\n13.\nThe requirement is the same for all who might expect to find themselves in the safekeeping of the Level Above Human - each must proceed in the forsaking of all human ways, ties, addictions, thinking, gender behavior (sexuality), and be in the forward motion of becoming this new creature (literally and physically belonging to the Kingdom Level Above Human). (Some in the class have chosen on their own to have their vehicles neutered in order to sustain a more genderless and objective consciousness.) The overcoming process can only be accomplished in the care, keeping, and tutorship of the present (incarnate) Representative(s) of that Next Kingdom.\n14.\nHumans in any given time seem to fall in one of three categories:\ni)\t\tHumans without deposits - those who are simply \"plants\" (a part of the various levels of human \"plant\" life) containing the mind or program of their genetic information combined with their brain's interpretation of the information of their current body's experiences,\nii)\t\tthose with deposits/souls who are receiving nourishment from the present Rep(s) toward metamorphic completion, and\niii)\t\tthose with deposits/souls who are not in a classroom nor in a direct relationship with the Representative(s) from the Level Beyond Human, having:\na) not been confronted with the information and the Rep(s), or\nb) been confronted but have chosen not to \"pursue.\"\n15.\nNow that we are here again, how an individual responds to us and our information will, in fact, judge that individual as to whether he or she will or will not have a further relationship with the Next Level. In other words, coming in contact with this information will force a decision for all with souls, and the stand they individually take will judge or determine their future. Remember, even those who have fallen away are being given an opportunity at this time to be reconciled or reinstated.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1970&amp;#39;s, two individuals (my task partner and myself) from the Evolutionary Level Above Human (the Kingdom of Heaven) incarnated into (moved into and took over) two human bodies that were in their forties.
