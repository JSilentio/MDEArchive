After a several years of their career, the trio has brought their style of comedy to formalist perfection without getting repetitive in [genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yFhR1fKWG0) and [formats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G9QIIvSpzE), while keeping a rare by YouTube standards [inaccessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1yrH4qS2RA) and [poetic quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er3vu2IVLjc) that many channels trade in for conformist popularity. The mix of newly found big budget and impressive experience has allowed the creators of \u201cWorld Peace\u201d to achieve a multidimensionality and, as a result, endless rewatchability in their skits, rivaling the classic absurdist sketch shows like \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus\u201d and \u201cTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\u201d.\n\n&gt;In their comedy, Sam, Nick, and Charls make it a goal to provoke the modern politically correct society. At the same time, surreal skits like the one about a crazy pick up artist training a disabled guy [to treat girls like garbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SwuoDtplfU), or a trilogy about a black, a Jewish, and a white guy [reacting to break ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIGjr3MuL3g) lack final punchlines or easy to pinpoint satirical aims. The funny part is often simply raw improv edited in such a way that the final cut might include a few versions of the same joke, and the characters breaking the forth wall with their awkward reactions and involuntary smirks.\n\n&gt;Despite the series being practically apolitical, a few months after the premiere some online publications like [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-alt-right-has-its-own-comedy-tv-show-on-a-time-warner-ne) and [Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/adult-swim-reportedly-removed-hidden-racist-messages-fr-1789090368) have accused the show of racism, sexism and homophobia, and made Sam Hyde--the frontman of the trio--look like an evil right winger by citing his [Twitter posts](https://twitter.com/night_0f_fire/status/751255059866976256) and some unconfirmed rumors about him hiding swastikas in the show\u2019s episodes. Hyde did vote for Donald Trump and even [bought a bike](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM3fIc3Ah4j/?taken-by=tube96o) after betting on Trump\u2019s win, but his current political views shouldn\u2019t define him as an artist and as a person.\n\n&gt;In their show, Sam Hyde and his partners don\u2019t really discriminate, instead they just don\u2019t care about offending one of the social groups--as a result, every group is offended. In [\u201cThe Wall Show\u201d sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scBOjH5sKbM) about a dating show, the object of ridicule are shallow and party-going 30-year-old women (one of them is bragging about living on benefits) who think of themselves as worthy of a young successful lawyer and are disgusted by a fat loser next to him. When the lawyer rejects them, the comedy takes aim at specific human vices, and not at women as a group. Actually, the most common satiric aim across the six episodes are white males, as the show includes skits about desperate gym goers, neurotic CEOs and school teachers, passive aggressive middle class sociopaths, and many others. The best sketch of the season, the existential and poetic [\u201cThe Man Who Would Never Be... What They Made Him to Be\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brdx7kmxx2I) stars Charls Carroll as an overly confident guy who gets a 10 year long prison sentence and rejects the reality of that happening until it\u2019s too late.\n\n***\n\n&gt;Back in 2010 Sam Hyde posted a classic (among the fans) video named [\u201cIMG 0612\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d47Jibt-EOE) in which he spontaneously made fun of corporate video portraits of the employees of some creative agency that he found online. In those videos too-normal-looking people listed their \u201cinspirations\u201d like music, creative ideas and memories of drinking cheap wine on top of a hill in Rome. The genius of Hyde\u2019s approach lies in that he doesn\u2019t record his reaction to obviously humorous content, rather, it\u2019s his commentary that transforms stupid and banal stuff into something truly funny. Hyde\u2019s influence across YouTube is hard to overestimate, given, for example, similar reaction videos produced by the famous youtuber [Ethan Klein](https://www.youtube.com/user/h3h3Productions) who [named](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/4hiykq/i_did_some_research_and_here_are_h3h3productions/) MDE one of his biggest [influences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ufw9tDaJ-w).\n\n&gt;In early 2016 Hyde returned to the reaction video format after a few years\u2019 break by making a magnum opus of this genre, the 8,5 hour long season of \u201cKickstarter TV\u201d. Across the 17 episodes Hyde mocks all the lazy and talentless users of the crowdfounding platform who are trying to get money for their idiotic and needless projects; some project categories like inspiring travels of single moms or the art of transsexuals get entire episodes dedicated to them. The pure comedic talent of Sam Hyde doesn\u2019t leave a boring or tiresome moment in the whole season, and his peak form insult comedy skills shine through the lo-fi recording quality that makes his shouting sound like white noise. During the bits where Hyde expresses his irritation by aggressively crashing his own furniture, one might think that the comedian is gradually losing his mind after realizing that he lives on the same planet as an adult man trying to gather a few thousand dollars to record an album of guitar songs inspired by \u201cMinecraft\u201d.\n\n&gt;The method of distributing \u201cKicktarter TV\u201d directly to fans makes it fair to compare Sam Hyde to Louis C. K. One of the key points that got Hyde [hired on Adult Swim](http://observer.com/2016/12/million-dollar-extremes-sam-hyde-speaks-out-on-adult-swim-cancellation/) was immense loyalty of MDE fans online, even though YouTube subscribers and views numbers aren\u2019t that impressive. The accusations of racism and homophobia did get the show [cancelled](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sam-hyde-speaks-meet-man-behind-adult-swims-canceled-alt-right-comedy-show-954487), and its creators virtually [blacklisted](http://splitsider.com/2016/12/sam-hyde-lashed-out-at-tim-heidecker-over-million-dollar-extremes-cancellation/), and so the most interesting question arising now is what new platforms and formats can Hyde, Carroll, and Rochefort turn to, in order to continue creating.\n", "edited": 1481839383.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a rough translation of the parts about &amp;quot;World Peace&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Kickstarter TV&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1\u20142. \u201cMillion Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace\u201d (Adult Swim, created by Sam Hyde, Nick Rochefort, Charls Carroll, Andrew Ruse) / \u201cKickstarter TV\u201d (Gumroad.com, created by Sam Hyde).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing one notices about the iconic YouTube trio Million Dollar Extreme\u2019s big studio debut is the set and sound designs that are unlike anything else on television, and may remind one of David Lynch\u2019s movies, and vaporwave.
