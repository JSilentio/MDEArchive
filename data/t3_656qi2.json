The common joke that NO ONE (other than Roosh V of course) understands women never made me laugh, it just made me feel inadequate. The way I think, there are men out there who have been to war, who have killed people, who have been under fire for hours at a time with a heart rate of 170, and even they struggle with women, get &amp;quot;divorce raped&amp;quot;, cheated on, etc. As a perpetually skinny guy who gets hit on by potentially pedophilic gays any time I go out, I&amp;#39;ve just never felt romantically confident in myself.

Sometimes I pray to God just to be able to hold someone who wants me back, it&amp;#39;s sick and sad, I know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the other day I decided to stop moping about it and actually DO something. That&amp;#39;s when I remembered the Asian race - the race of handjobs. Luckily, living in the valley, there is no shortage of Asian salons and massage parlors. I caught an uber to a salon named &amp;quot;Hot Spa&amp;quot;, that I heard about on an Internet forum of people who LIVE for Asian handjobs. A guy named &amp;quot;ChinkTinglez&amp;quot; rated the place five stars. I was excited just at the prospect of having a decent time sexually. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went in and ordered a &amp;quot;full body massage&amp;quot;, but the lady at the counter didn&amp;#39;t understand me, so I said &amp;quot;four brody massrage&amp;quot; and then she nodded her head, confirming what I was paying for. I was then escorted to a massage table in a run-down looking corner room, nestled on the right side of a long oriental wallpapered hallway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when the massage therapist came in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was absolutely beautiful. She had to have had some sort of surgery, I thought to myself. Why is she doing this shitty job? I should save her just like Travis saved the prostitue girl in Taxi Driver - I should blow these chinks away, they have to be holding her hostage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the table face down when she started to run down my lower back with scented oils. Then I remembered the cluster of pimples on my left ass cheek, a tight bundle of pustulating sores that have been giving me trouble for a few weeks. She got closer to them, and I could feel the deep cavern of bloody puss buckle under the pressure of her hands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt hot liquid running down my ass crack, and it wasn&amp;#39;t the oil. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t seem to notice, or if she did, she didn&amp;#39;t seem to care. She asked me to turn over, with my ass juice gleaming on her fingers. I was red hot in the face, and literally unable to speak. I was on the precipice of a potentially positive sexual experience, but at the same time, her hands were covered with bloody curdled pimple juice. I was understandably conflicted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She put two fingers on my urethra, and I felt some of the juice slide down my peehole. I felt like I was going to throw up, but at the same time I had flutters in my heart and that comfortable burning sensation in my chest, that common sexual feeling. I was completely aroused as she began to stroke faster and faster, and the smell of the pimple juice grew and grew with the friction. How could she not smell it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew more sick as I grew more sexually aroused, creating a very confusing blend between disturbia and pleasure. Then, completely out of no where, I went flaccid. 100 to Zero in mere seconds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked at me with confusion, and I did the same to her. &amp;quot;Uh...&amp;quot; I said, but it sounded more like a burp than anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next part will stay with me forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She reached underneath my ass, squeezed the cluster of pimples, then rubbed her hands together, completely lubing them in what looked like bloody lemon marangue pie custard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This confirmed my worst fear. She was doing it on purpose! My mind rang with thoughts of what could possibly be wrong with this bitch. There&amp;#39;s no way I could trust her anywhere near my penis or my butthole. I got up and bolted, dick out, ass naked,  down the hallway and into the main area of Hot Spa, carrying my pants in my arms like a football. As I ran out the door I heard the Doppler effect, like when a car passes you, but instead with a bunch of nagging Asian voices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to get into an Uber with only pants on, and the guy almost kicked me out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened yesterday.
