There are lots of reasons: because wage rates aren't determined by individual firms but by determined by institutions and policies, because the composition of economies naturally ineluctably has less numerous and higher-paying jobs and more numerous and lower-paying jobs, because someone's kids would starve to death in the time it would take for someone to jump from one job to the next, etc.\n\nThe libertarian (chicago / austrian) way of looking at economics isn't wrong because it's \"cold-hearted\" or whatever, but because it's epistemologically wrong: viewing everything from the perspective of a single actor within the economy only lets you see better and worse options within that given framework, but it doesn't let you see how that framework itself is being changed. In our case, for example, the economy is being changed toward a framework of less jobs that pay high enough to support a family and more jobs that could support ten families.\n\nSo when you say something like \"minimum wage hikes are wrong because people should have incentives to move past burger-flipping\", you're not wrong but you are being obtuse and missing the point, which is that in the post-industrial economy, non-burger-flipping jobs became relatively scarcer and that more people are going to have to occupy the bottom rung of society.
