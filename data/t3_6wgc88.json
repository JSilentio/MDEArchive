I&amp;#39;m after throwing away literally hundreds of pounds of paper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the videos are pretty priceless, travelling across the world and making friends that I may never ever see again. Photos that I need for various government processes etc and a million other things without trying to get personal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also a lot of old programs, bookmarks, just stuff. And it would be nice to access from anywhere but obviously that is not going to be possible when they snoop and censor and act like cunts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Druggies act like cunts too and they will break into your house and rob your computer, then you lose all of that stuff, because you can&amp;#39;t trust cloud hosting because it&amp;#39;s all ((cunted)) up, so you are left to rely on your own brain!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all that being said, what other option is there than other places. Maybe a safety security box. Or your grandmas. Its not that hard. Its not expensive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your hard drive could crash tomorrow and you lose everything and you don&amp;#39;t care, then maybe you aren&amp;#39;t living right. Or maybe you have everything you need right in your own home.
