The world doesn&amp;#39;t change for either Wendy or Pinnocchio, rather they begin as a flawed outsider, go off on a journey and return renewed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6olpjp/has_anyone_else_noticed_that_you_can_see_a_clear/dkj96a3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dkj96a3", "created": 1500692206.0, "author_flair_text": "What are you, a shit bitch?", "created_utc": 1500663406.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dkj7rjb", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rudeawaken1ng", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 5, "parent_id": "t3_6olpjp", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "(Well, shit, it looks like I accidentally went and wrote a book.

They replaced the hero's journey with \"everyone's special\" bullshit and people are eating it up.  They also progressively neutered fairy tales. Also Furries may (or may not) be Disney's fault.\n\n\n\nOkay, I think about this a lot these days, and my wife and I have come up with something of a theory. This may ramble a bit as I've never put it in writing before, but I'll try to be as concise as possible. Bear with me.  \n\n\n\nIn America, and mostly with Disney at the helm of modern storytelling, we have lost all semblance of both fairy tales and mythology as they are classically understood.  The first thing to go was the fairy tales; what once were dark, graphic and even sinister means of exposing children to the dark side of human nature (murder, kidnapping, rape) and teaching moral lessons (I.e. if you lie,  people will stop believing you) in a way they could process, Disney replaced with toothless stories about falling in love. That was the first subversive thing they did. It was a slow process.  From the 30s to the 50s they did produce a handful of darker tales (Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland come to mind), but this was also during the period where proper fairy tales like Cinderella and Peter Pan were losing their teeth, and sheltering children from truths they would in decades and centuries prior have been exposed to through fiction.  \n\n\n\nA couple of other things started happening in this era of Disney. First, starting mildly in movies like Pinocchio, then ramping up quickly through Dumbo, Cinderella and Lady and the Tramp, we see the New Narrative forming. The Old Narrative was the Hero's Journey, in which a character begins in a place of comfort, wants/needs something, goes somewhere unfamiliar, adapts to it, gets what he is seeking, pays a heavy price for it, and returns, changed, to the place of comfort. There was also a lot that went into the formation of a good protagonist, under the Old Narrative, as well as the formation of a good hero (which is distinct from the protagonist).  But the New Narrative could better be called the Outcast's Journey. If I were to throw together an outline for this, it would go something like:\n\n\n\n\n\nProtagonist begins in a familiar place, but is quirky and resides uncomfortably on the fringes of society,\n\n\n\nHe wants to fit in, so he goes to an unfamiliar place, experiences danger, and is saved from danger by the very quirks that made him an outcast. \n\n\n\nHe becomes comfortable in his weirdness, does NOT usually pay a heavy price for this new comfort unless it will be returned to him by the end of the story, and returns to the Familiar Uncomfortable Place, now secure within himself, and the Familiar Place changes, accepting him, and he is now comfortable. \n\n\n\n\n\nThink of Dumbo's ears making him the star of the show, or Tramp's connections and street smarts saving Lady (though it is in fact her place of comfort that changes in the end). The differences between the Old and New Narratives may seem subtle, and in the old days of Disney, some movies could fit into both narratives simultaneously, but the emphasis on quirkiness saving the day and the WORLD changing around the protagonist have had very significant psychological effects on the children who grew up on them, instead of an exclusive diet of Old Narrative stories. Remember this narrative next time a Boomer you know gets divorced, gets a new S/O and a new car, goes traveling, and then expects everyone, even her kids, to cheer her on and act like nothing ever happened. Remember it next time a tattooed and pierced Gen-Exer tells you about how \"really, what even is normal anyway,\" and \"what really matters is who you are on the inside.\" Remember it next time a Millenial tells you about how the UBI will finally solve the problems of inequality faced by panromantic genderfluid demisexual starfishkin like xyrself.\n\n\n\nThe second thing that first started in the 30s-50s era of Disney was the eroticization of anthropomorphic animals. No, not in the sense that they were supposed to be sexy, but in the sense that they were given.... lets call it romantic agency. There were songs about it (think \"twitterpated\"), creating a \"mood\" that the viewing child experiences, but has no frame of reference to understand, and it usually culminates in what very well may be the first on-screen kiss that child has seen. Think Robin Hood, Lady and the Tramp, The Fox and the Hound, and The Lion King.  This, I suspect, could very well have been a contributing factor in the Rise of the Furries, and those communities that have followed in their wake. Or maybe im full of shit here.  This part is really peripheral to my main assertions, take it or leave it as you will. \n\n\n\nSubsequent decades saw somewhat more overt and specific attempts to influence the culture. One example of this is in the 1961 movie The Parent Trap, which, though prior to the realization of the effects of the Summer of Love and No-Fault Divorce, began the process of normalizing divorce by presenting a divorce that is seemingly the villain of the story (and symbolized by the father's new fiancee) without, as far as I can tell, either parent being at fault for it.  This is how normalization of a thing occurs: it is portrayed first as evil, then it is trivialized (as is divorce in the parent trap), then it is represented as regrettable, misunderstood evil, then as anti-heroic, and finally, it can be portrayed as good.  In addition to this sort of thing, the defanging of the fairy tale continued all the way through 1989's The Little Mermaids, which also serves as an example of The Outcast's Journey. \n\n\n\nThe 1990s saw what I believe to be the complete supplanting of the Old Narrative by the New, along with experimentation with Ambiguous and Misunderstood Villains, as seen (to varying degrees) in Beauty and the Beast, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Aladdin, A Bug's Life, and Tarzan, among others. This trend carried on through the 2000s, though in this decade Disney offered a greater and more diversified catalogue of movies than in decades prior, and then in 2013, 2014 and 2016, we see the culmination of this New Narrative, as Frozen, Maleficent and Zootopia take the box office by storm. Movies that would barely have registered as coherent stories when Disney began are now devoured by audiences raised on the progressive shift from the old narrative to the new. \n\n\n\nNow, I mentioned previously that mythology has also suffered with disney at the helm of our cultural storytelling.  Here is why: in America, we have two sources for proper mythology; the first is the classic Americana tall-tales about figures both real and fictional (characters like john Henry, paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, and johnny appleseed,  alongside embellished tales of men such as Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone,  Paul Revere, Johnny Tremaine, and possibly even those as recent as Sgt York and General MacArthur), and the second is the old stories of Uncle Remus, brought over by African slaves, preserved by Joel Chandler Harris, and beloved by black and white children alike.\n\n\n\nDisney did in fact make a number of movies that drew upon the first kind of mythology; however, as the decades went by, these became less and less frequent. The last one I am aware of is 1995's Tall Tale.  I haven't seen all of the movies that fit into this category, but I can find no fault with the ones I have seen. However, they are slowly dropping off the radar of more recent generations, and it will be interesting to see if they are ever released from the Disney vault. It is worth noting, though, that just a few short months after Tall Tale was released, Disney bestowed Pocahontas upon us, and since then has not returned to classic  americana mythology (except for The Lone Ranger, which I have not seen).\n\n\n\nThe second category of mythology was actually imbued into 1946's  Song of the South, and has never been released in its entirety for vhs or DVD (at least not in the US). However, characters from it (such as Brer Bear) have been converted from villains into good guys for other Disney pictures.\n\n\n\nThe former kind of mythology could most closely be compared to The Odyssey; the latter, to Ovid's Metamorphoses. The absence of both these kinds of mythology has left a vacuum in our cultural consciousness, which Disney has filled with their retooled version of the fairy tale. We have even reached the point, with the advent of movies like Tangled and Brave, where classical fairy tales are coopted to feed our appetite for legend,  functioning instead  as New Narrative myths. The mythological appetites left unsated by such tales are then filled up with superhero stories, and thereby the complete purge of both Old Narrative mythology and the practical and visceral messages of classical fairy tales is accomplished. \n\n\n\nThe question remains of whether disney did this intentionally, or was merely reacting to market forces.  I am inclined to say that the place in the human psyche that is reserved for stories would not change the \"shape\" of the stories it prefers without intentional prior conditioning, but i can't be certain. I do think, however, that the effects of the New Narrative on the mindsets of recent generations are clear. It is likely true that not every movie disney has produced was structured according to the New Narrative (Davy Crockett was pretty good, as was UP), but I still think the general trend, especially among their blockbusters, has been from Old to New Narrative pretty consistently from Disney's earliest days.  \n\n\n\nIf you read this whole thing, something's likely wrong with you.
