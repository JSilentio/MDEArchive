There was little his captors could do in the way of actually holding him, because he was so cunning and resourceful. He would come and go from the facility as he pleased. Plotting elaborate escapes only to be recaught weeks later, on purpose for fun. Committing unspeakable atrocities in the meantime. This caused much stress and agony for Badtanman.
