This is the full answer about World Peace from the original Vice interview:\n\n&gt;I've talked about it with people. I was out in Minnesota, and the label got in touch and said, \"A show on Adult Swim wants you to be on it.\" I was like, \"Oh, Adult Swim.\"\n\n&gt;I love TV. I watch a lot of TV. I knew Space Ghost and I knew Tim and Eric. I'm like, \"Cool. This is awesome.\" I said, \"What's their name?\"\n\n&gt;I googled, and I just see this video of a guy in Roman armor taking a piss on a TED lecture. Now after everything we've said, obviously I'm like, \"Right on. Fucking TED.\" Then I saw some other stuff, where they were taking a piss on, whatever, cool people in Brooklyn and stuff like that. I liked their target so far as I could see.\n\n&gt;I said, \"Oh yeah, they look like cool dudes. I'll go and do this.\" I said, \"I want to sleep on the couch.\" I didn't want to come in and just sing a song and go. I wanted to be on the set and see. It was cool, the whole place, and to be on a TV set. They were super nice.\nThen a few months later or whatever, one of the people from the label was like, \"Yo, did you see this? You gotta say something.\" \"They're Nazis,\" or something like that.\n\n&gt;Shit. A cult of a race and blood\u2014that's an absolute obscenity. That's nothing other than disaster. That's just inarguably obscene, that sort of ideology.\n\n&gt;If the question too is why not just throw in your two cents about it or whatever, it's just so insanely complicated the way the biopolitics and the cults of race and blood, the residues of that, are rearing their ugly faces again in our situation. That's too complicated a thing to try to touch with [140] characters without running the risk of just turning the screw.\n\n&gt;I don't want to make any apology, but I also didn't want to... The guys I met were nice. They weren't burning crosses or doing anything like that. In other words, I never had, from what I know about it, any indication that anything other than certain instances of a sort of trolling was going on. What did they do that made them Nazis? Maybe I haven't looked into it. Or why were they alt-right people?\n\n&gt;Q: Even the show itself has been accused of having racist characters.\n\n&gt;The one I was on, there was a sketch at the beginning of it where these guys are sitting at a wine-tasting party or something like that, and their wives are there, and they make a point of the character\u2014one of the wives is off-putting. She scowls and things like that. One of the guys trips her, and she falls through glass, and it tears up her face, and she's bleeding.\n\n&gt;Now immediately, I'm thinking of Metalocalypse. I'm thinking of phantasmagorical humor, like a person gets their arm ripped off or something, and there's something absurd about that. I didn't think much beyond that about it.\n\n&gt;Then people were like, \"This is a misogynist sketch.\" Then in that sense I'm thinking of the French feminist theory, this whole reading of it from that standpoint: the men do not acknowledge the woman as an agent, as having any subjectivity. She's just an object in their patriarchal economy. In that sense, it's like a feminist critique of where a woman is made to stand in a patriarchal, heteronormative reality. The idea that it just encourages violence against women, maybe I'm just too dumb. I didn't see that or something like that. I don't know.\n\n&gt;Q: Are you receptive to hearing stuff like that\u2014to being challenged by people?\n\n&gt;Absolutely, but I've always considered my own politics, in whatever sense you can put them on a spectrum, left of left of left of left.\n\n&gt;By and large, before any of this, I regarded the media and Washington as more or less a spectacle that was finally not where the locus of power in our situation lies. The networks of AT&amp;T, the management of data packets\u2014all these sorts of things seem to me to be more politically effective than the residues of some 18th century dainty Whig representative democracy chimera thing going on. Then of course, this all has real political effects. Just little quips and soundbites don't lend themselves to any sort of change. It blew my mind, the whole thing. I didn't know where the way in was.\n\n&gt;Q: You were shocked that they were accused of being Nazis, basically?\n\n&gt;Maybe I didn't look into it hard enough. What sort of imbecile is going to pay alms, as I keep saying, to some race or something like that? To me, that's beneath contempt. It's taken for granted that such a thing as that is beneath contempt.\n\n&gt;Q: These people do exist.\n\n&gt;I know they do. I saw it certainly in the election. It's so complicated. I don't want to do one of the easy positions on it, because it's all the vulgarity of biopolitics, as it's called. It's already much deeper than the clowns that don't want the statue of the Confederate general torn down. I get why that is obscene. I understand that, but where the conditions of possibility for that sort of obscenity finally lie is in a much broader... I don't even like touching this with a stick. They exist, yeah. Help me out here. What am I trying to say?\n\n&gt;Q: This is gonna sound like a weird way in, but are you familiar with the band Prefab Sprout? There's a solo album by the guy from that band called I Trawl the Megahertz , which should be totally unrelated to this conversation, except that Sam Hyde mentioned that album in an interview as something that he liked. Now there are people posting racial slurs on a Youtube video for that album. How does that make you feel, as someone who's also associated with Sam's work?\n\n&gt;You can't do that. I used to think for a super long time when I saw YouTube comments and Yahoo comments, like, \"I can't believe this.\" Then I only found out a couple years ago, way behind the curve, that these were all 15-year-old kids or whatever, just trying to say the most scandalous, outrageous, horrifying thing they could say, for shock value or whatever. No, you can't do that. You can't do that.\n\n&gt;After Auschwitz, [German philosopher Theodor] Adorno's over here, having escaped, and his friends, [Walter] Benjamin included, died in this disaster, and he's like, \"Look, Auschwitz gives us a new categorical imperative, and that's that Auschwitz never happen again\"\u2014and anybody who would argue with it, they've already lost on the face that they're showing themselves to be barbarous. Anything\u2014any action\u2014that seems to go in that direction is precisely ethically what ought to be avoided.\n\n&gt;Q: Maybe this is a na\u00efve version of the question, but if those people are aware of your music now, do you want them listening to it? Do you want them at your shows?\n\n&gt;If you would stand by and watch a pig smash the head of a trans person because they're trans, fuck you. If you would watch a pig shoot a toddler in a park and not try to stop him, then yes, fuck you. Finally it comes down to, if you don't have a sort of indignance when you see atrocities committed, you're not communing with the same humanity that I am.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article takes liberties with the quotes.

This is awesome.&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s their name?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I googled, and I just see this video of a guy in Roman armor taking a piss on a TED lecture. Now after everything we&amp;#39;ve said, obviously I&amp;#39;m like, &amp;quot;Right on. Fucking TED.&amp;quot; Then I saw some other stuff, where they were taking a piss on, whatever, cool people in Brooklyn and stuff like that. I liked their target so far as I could see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;quot;Oh yeah, they look like cool dudes. I&amp;#39;ll go and do this.&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;I want to sleep on the couch.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to come in and just sing a song and go. I wanted to be on the set and see. It was cool, the whole place, and to be on a TV set. They were super nice.\nThen a few months later or whatever, one of the people from the label was like, &amp;quot;Yo, did you see this? You gotta say something.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re Nazis,&amp;quot; or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shit. A cult of a race and blood\u2014that&amp;#39;s an absolute obscenity. That&amp;#39;s nothing other than disaster. That&amp;#39;s just inarguably obscene, that sort of ideology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the question too is why not just throw in your two cents about it or whatever, it&amp;#39;s just so insanely complicated the way the biopolitics and the cults of race and blood, the residues of that, are rearing their ugly faces again in our situation. That&amp;#39;s too complicated a thing to try to touch with [140] characters without running the risk of just turning the screw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to make any apology, but I also didn&amp;#39;t want to... The guys I met were nice. They weren&amp;#39;t burning crosses or doing anything like that. In other words, I never had, from what I know about it, any indication that anything other than certain instances of a sort of trolling was going on. What did they do that made them Nazis? Maybe I haven&amp;#39;t looked into it. Or why were they alt-right people?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: Even the show itself has been accused of having racist characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one I was on, there was a sketch at the beginning of it where these guys are sitting at a wine-tasting party or something like that, and their wives are there, and they make a point of the character\u2014one of the wives is off-putting. She scowls and things like that. One of the guys trips her, and she falls through glass, and it tears up her face, and she&amp;#39;s bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now immediately, I&amp;#39;m thinking of Metalocalypse. I&amp;#39;m thinking of phantasmagorical humor, like a person gets their arm ripped off or something, and there&amp;#39;s something absurd about that. I didn&amp;#39;t think much beyond that about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then people were like, &amp;quot;This is a misogynist sketch.&amp;quot; Then in that sense I&amp;#39;m thinking of the French feminist theory, this whole reading of it from that standpoint: the men do not acknowledge the woman as an agent, as having any subjectivity. She&amp;#39;s just an object in their patriarchal economy. In that sense, it&amp;#39;s like a feminist critique of where a woman is made to stand in a patriarchal, heteronormative reality. The idea that it just encourages violence against women, maybe I&amp;#39;m just too dumb. I didn&amp;#39;t see that or something like that. I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: Are you receptive to hearing stuff like that\u2014to being challenged by people?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely, but I&amp;#39;ve always considered my own politics, in whatever sense you can put them on a spectrum, left of left of left of left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By and large, before any of this, I regarded the media and Washington as more or less a spectacle that was finally not where the locus of power in our situation lies. The networks of AT&amp;amp;T, the management of data packets\u2014all these sorts of things seem to me to be more politically effective than the residues of some 18th century dainty Whig representative democracy chimera thing going on. Then of course, this all has real political effects. Just little quips and soundbites don&amp;#39;t lend themselves to any sort of change. It blew my mind, the whole thing. I didn&amp;#39;t know where the way in was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: You were shocked that they were accused of being Nazis, basically?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I didn&amp;#39;t look into it hard enough. What sort of imbecile is going to pay alms, as I keep saying, to some race or something like that? To me, that&amp;#39;s beneath contempt. It&amp;#39;s taken for granted that such a thing as that is beneath contempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: These people do exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know they do. I saw it certainly in the election. It&amp;#39;s so complicated. I don&amp;#39;t want to do one of the easy positions on it, because it&amp;#39;s all the vulgarity of biopolitics, as it&amp;#39;s called. It&amp;#39;s already much deeper than the clowns that don&amp;#39;t want the statue of the Confederate general torn down. I get why that is obscene. I understand that, but where the conditions of possibility for that sort of obscenity finally lie is in a much broader... I don&amp;#39;t even like touching this with a stick. They exist, yeah. Help me out here. What am I trying to say?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: This is gonna sound like a weird way in, but are you familiar with the band Prefab Sprout? There&amp;#39;s a solo album by the guy from that band called I Trawl the Megahertz , which should be totally unrelated to this conversation, except that Sam Hyde mentioned that album in an interview as something that he liked. Now there are people posting racial slurs on a Youtube video for that album. How does that make you feel, as someone who&amp;#39;s also associated with Sam&amp;#39;s work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t do that. I used to think for a super long time when I saw YouTube comments and Yahoo comments, like, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe this.&amp;quot; Then I only found out a couple years ago, way behind the curve, that these were all 15-year-old kids or whatever, just trying to say the most scandalous, outrageous, horrifying thing they could say, for shock value or whatever. No, you can&amp;#39;t do that. You can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Auschwitz, [German philosopher Theodor] Adorno&amp;#39;s over here, having escaped, and his friends, [Walter] Benjamin included, died in this disaster, and he&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Look, Auschwitz gives us a new categorical imperative, and that&amp;#39;s that Auschwitz never happen again&amp;quot;\u2014and anybody who would argue with it, they&amp;#39;ve already lost on the face that they&amp;#39;re showing themselves to be barbarous. Anything\u2014any action\u2014that seems to go in that direction is precisely ethically what ought to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: Maybe this is a na\u00efve version of the question, but if those people are aware of your music now, do you want them listening to it? Do you want them at your shows?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would stand by and watch a pig smash the head of a trans person because they&amp;#39;re trans, fuck you. If you would watch a pig shoot a toddler in a park and not try to stop him, then yes, fuck you. Finally it comes down to, if you don&amp;#39;t have a sort of indignance when you see atrocities committed, you&amp;#39;re not communing with the same humanity that I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/75zs2i/hitpiece_alert_john_maus_speaks_on_involvement/doaszji/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_doaszji", "created": 1507897026.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1507868226.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "doalowh", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nesquik", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t1_doa6c4r", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "maybe i'm reading it wrong but him saying\n&gt;Shit.
