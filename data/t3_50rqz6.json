Or a person could just have a mental illness and is using the substance to numb their own fear of confronting their own shortcomings. \n\nSo I feel like you need to really be asking yourself what your objectives are, what are you trying to achieve, why do you do something? Not just with weed, but with all of your behavior, understanding why you do things and what your end goals are is important to living a more fulfilling life and actually being a real human being. A lot of people do drugs not because they feel any sense of responsibility, or know what they are after, but just because they want to feel fucked up and separated from their own sadness. \n\nI've had friends, and roomies, they'd dump hundreds of dollars on weed a month, they would literally will sit around and smoke ALL DAY, to the point where they are smoking to feel normal, as opposed to smoking it for some aesthetic purpose, or to feel out of the ordinary. They forget things that literally happened yesterday. Before we do ANYTHING they HAVE to be high, they have to take a hit before we go for a walk, they have to spend 20 minutes packing a bowl and going to go take a hit before they watch a funny video with the rest of their non-smoking friends, they will get up and fuck around on their phone in the middle of a good movie, and have to pause it a half dozen times to go take a hit, they have to smoke before we go to get groceries, they have to smoke before we eat anything, they have to smoke before they read a book, they have to smoke before they pet the cat, they have to smoke before they listen to music, etc. \n\nAsked a friend once how many times he felt like he went out and hit his glass piece that day, he said, \"I 'unno\", I told him 24 times (I counted), he just kind of shrugged and didn't care. If someone is a two-pack a day smoker, and doesn't even realize it, we would recognize that as a problem. \n\nYou say you feel under control, you say you feel like it isn't affecting you, and maybe it isn't, but instead of focusing on the negatives and if it's hurting you or not, how about you focus on the positives? \n\nAre there things you've developed, written, photographed, created, invented, etc. while you were high that you ABSOLUTELY would not have done otherwise? \n\nCount up all of the money you've spent on it each month, what about each year, what about your entire life? Is there something that could benefit your life more that you could have spent that money on instead? \n\nAre you more confident, more calm, your thoughts more organized, your work easier, art improved, and your life overall better by your consumption? \n\nDo you live in a state where it's legal? Do you not? If you don't what's the legal risk involved, what happens if a mean cop with it out for you finds a baggie on you in your state, is that worth it to you? \n\nSo if you're getting something out of it that is CLEARLY irreplaceable, if you have nothing else you need to be spending your money on, if you have clear objectives in mind about why you smoke it, you've been using it for a long time and have never used it more than you have told yourself you would, and it's overall positives are clear to you while you're sober. By all means, ignore all advice to the contrary. \n\nIf you've reflected on it, and you don't feel like the benefits outweigh the neutrals or negatives, maybe you should reconsider it. \n\nSam isn't a neuroscientist, maybe he isn't the end all of the discussion. But also maybe as someone who has seen a lot of friends loose their incentive and be less motivated, and have it take up way more of their life than it should... Maybe he is worth listening to even if he isn't the beacon of never-ending truth in every discussion. \n\nGo to /r/leaves if you want to hear something outside of the trees echo chamber.
