Many HIV-negative friends have told me\nthey won\u2019t have sex with anyone they know to be positive. And I\u2019ve heard from\nthe other side too: from positive friends with horror stories about the\ndifficulties they face in dating or even hooking up. For them, the quest for\nlove and sex can be an obstacle course of thoughtless discrimination and\nrejection. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I understand that negative guys might get\nturned off when they hear that a hookup is HIV-positive. For most people,\ndisease isn\u2019t sexy. But there\u2019s an easy solution to that problem: Just don\u2019t\ntalk about it. It might also ruin the mood if Mr. Right Now revealed that he\nhad liver cancer, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, or a family history of mental\nillness. But why would he tell you those things on a first date? And why would\nyou ask?\n\nThe answer, some might say, has to do with managing the risk\nof contagion.

Do they also think they can get AIDS from toilet\nseats?\n\nYou can\u2019t get HIV from kissing. In fact, it\u2019s hard to get\nHIV even from sex \u2014 as long as you use a condom. I dated a positive guy for two\nyears in the 1990s; we had safe sex almost every day, and I never\nseroconverted. Today, it is even more difficult to become infected through\nprotected sex. Recent studies suggest that HIV-positive men who are taking\ntheir medications pose a vastly reduced risk of transmitting the virus. \n\nBut shunning HIV-positive people is not just phobic and\nunkind \u2014 it is also dangerous. Paradoxically, a supposed open discussion about\nHIV actually leads to a culture of HIV secrecy; it punishes men who are honest\nabout their status, rewards those who lie, and discourages guys from getting\ntested (and treated).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it perpetuates a growing trend toward barebacking\nby men who think that they can stay negative as long as they only hook up with\nother negative guys. I don't know anyone who has seroconverted from safe sex\nwith an HIV-positive partner \u2014 but I know several who have gotten HIV from\nboyfriends who were barebacking on the side. \n\nThe problem is, an honest guy may tell you he\u2019s positive, but\nyou can never reliably know who\u2019s negative. A guy you meet on Manhunt may tell\nyou he got tested last month \u2014 but are you really going to take the word of a\nguy whom you met under a pseudonym and whose profile probably shaves four\nyears off his age and adds two inches to his dick? Even if he thinks he\u2019s\ntelling the truth, he may have been infected since. \n\nIt boils down to this: The real way to avoid HIV is not by\navoiding people with HIV; it\u2019s by avoiding practices that make HIV\ncommunicable. If you want to stay negative, assume that everyone you hook up\nwith is positive, and wear a condom to protect yourself.\n\nIf the relationship moves beyond sex, there will be a time\nwhen it\u2019s appropriate to talk about your medical histories. That may mean\ncontinuing to practice safe sex \u2014 but if you love a guy, a thin layer of rubber\nshouldn\u2019t be enough to keep you apart. \n\nUntil then, it\u2019s none of your business. Leave HIV status off\nyour hookup checklists and Manhunt profiles and pre-sex chatter. In this case,\nignorance really can be bliss: There are a huge number of super-hot,\nHIV-positive guys out there that HIV-negative men are losing out on.\n\nIt\u2019s time to rid the gay community of the irrational fears\nand discrimination that have held us back for far too long.
