I will show how this Magnum Opus: 1-25 represents the true views and importance of MDE, which are often confused by the nihaive college-student audience of MDE. What I mean by this is that MDE (particularly Mr. Hyde #a blatantly obvious reference to the work of Mark Twain#) are often construed as either being &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;alt-right&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; with regards to politics or a parody of the &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;alt-right&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; stillmeans. I will explain that MDE are actually both, not just with regards to the norm-left but in everything. MDE are simultaneously alt-right and not alt-right. Religious and non-religious. Capitalist and socialist. God and mortal. Feminist and meninist. Racist and racially egalitarian. Etc. etc. etc. MDE simultaneously believe in and represent every single idea ever conceived by sentient beings (human, alien, or divine) and believe in absolutely nothing and/or nobody. They represent the entire gamut of conceivable and inconceivable ideas ever divined by humankind, or ever will be divined, or will never be and never have been except in imagination or even not in imagination. So now that this simple Dimefront bullet point is out of the way, let me specifically analyze the movie in question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charls Bombstrap begins with an ancient-archaic style MDE title sequence and then a mechanical voice, likely a Microsoft processor from the 1990&amp;#39;s, describing why the aforementioned video was being made. This already represents a common thread of MDE (and proves its a common thread by using the title sequence, rarely seen in 2015 MDE videos ). The potential optimism of the 90&amp;#39;s for the new millennium ahead. A whole new thousand years of wonderful accomplishments by the great human species. Think of what we did from 1000-2000 A.D. and now try to imagine what will happen in 2000-3000. But of course, as we all [k]now know, the new millennium actually represents a new but also olde Dark Ages. This sets the aesthetics for all MDE videos since the year 2001, when they first began. This mechanical voice describes what Charls would have done had MDE not gotten a show on Adult Swim. It&amp;#39;s unusual that we need to see this because MDE did get a contract deal with [as] and this is even acknowledged in the theatrical presentation. This creates a divide between the real and the unreal, like South Parks imaginationland except without the ambiguously Mormon-Catholic fart jokes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This review will be continued, concluded, and given a final rating in my second post regarding this particularly subject matter (I?E?
