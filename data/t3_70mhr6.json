If they want to call Paul Ryan a bastard they call him a bastard. If they want to crack jokes about abortion they crack jokes. That's their appeal; the typical severity, the \"elitism\" that usually permeates left-wing commentary is drained from the discussion, while the actual ideology stays intact.\n\nThe author of the piece seems to believe that the transgressive right has a grip on the tap and that Chapo is taking drinks from it. But I would argue that they've totally mis-read the situation; the shitlords think they control the tap and Chapo (and other dirtbag leftists) are making fun of them for thinking so. Their aim isn't the shitlords, it's the business and other elites, and if anything, Chapo spends lots of time laughing at right-wing dweebs who think they have any control over the spectacle. Especially the more extreme sides of the alt-right are completely governed by spectacle; actual material conditions or policies don't seem to matter as long as their society is racially (i.e. visually) intact and the enemy is pushed out.\n\nedit: this is pasta from some kind of supreme intellectuals subreddit", "edited": 1505651686.0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nah I don&amp;#39;t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes Chapo appealing is that it&amp;#39;s left commentary that isn&amp;#39;t sanitized.
