Slick looking, eye popping and ever important transitions, that they are able to make funny in themselves.

Where most comedy is lacking is in the seemingly unnecessary that MDE has capitalized on. Comedy people seem to reject the notion you need to be different in ways other than just your point of view, and most times comedy is just holding a mirror up to itself.

It made me feel sympathetically powerless how Charls was treated. But I don&amp;#39;t know if an entire episode of that skit would be good television, that skit is great because of how melancholic it felt in contrast to the laughs from the rest of the show. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great post, thanks for posting. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/686w71/mde_video_formula_hyde_wars/dgwmgmt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dgwmgmt", "created": 1493497861.0, "author_flair_text": "The only morality is civilization.", "created_utc": 1493469061.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_686w71", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dgwh7mo", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "punxsatawneyphuck", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 5, "parent_id": "t3_686w71", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "youre right", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;youre right&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/686w71/mde_video_formula_hyde_wars/dgwh7mo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dgwh7mo", "created": 1493481505.0, "author_flair_text": "marmaduke", "created_utc": 1493452705.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_686w71", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dgwi1a3", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "subwade", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 7, "parent_id": "t3_686w71", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "*their\n\nOtherwise, this is awesome.
