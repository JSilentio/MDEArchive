He&amp;#39;s wearing a tank top, really bright eye-catching red shorts, these big sunglasses which are so reflective that you can&amp;#39;t even see his eyes, and he had this white paste all over his nose probably to make himself appear whiter and remind everyone of his skin color.

I&amp;#39;m ashamed to admit but eventually it just fucking got to me. I was feeling completely exposed being on display for him like that, and it wore me down. After only swimming for about 5 minutes I got back out of the pool and quickly went to cover myself with a towel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I did this, he got down from his chair and again started walking past me. He smirked again and the fucker said &amp;quot;Have a nice day,&amp;quot; but I knew he didn&amp;#39;t actually mean it.
