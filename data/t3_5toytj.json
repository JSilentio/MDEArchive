But then I discovered he wasn't using a condom. I certainly would not have consented to having unprotected sex, and that's something you can never take back.

One discussion in particular, he claimed that I had somehow deeply injured him (I don't remember what I did) and was inconsolable. I kept asking him what I could do, and finally he insisted that for him to feel better I needed to clean his floors naked. And I did it. I cried the whole time, in surreal horror.
