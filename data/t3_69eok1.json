Ten thousand? Ballpark. It&amp;#39;s been three weeks since he nabbed anything bigger than a tin can, and his employers were getting impatient. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t want to startle the goo, so he kept his moves slow and deliberate.

It mobilised, slithering at breakneck speed to avoid Thomaseth&amp;#39;s crosshairs. It strafed in a zig-zag pattern, preparing to pounce. It jumped, and at the last second dove beneath his legs. Thomaseth smirked. He&amp;#39;d seen it a hundred times. The classic over-under manoeuvre. Not one to be outdone by a goo, he responded in turn. Thomaseth did a spinning corkscrew jump kind of like Mario in Super Mario 64, landed on one knee and fired a plasma bolt at the goo in one swift movement. The goo dodged to the right, and fired a goo-based projectile that Thomaseth was quick to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thomaseth smirked again. &amp;quot;A tough guy, huh?&amp;quot; He followed the zigzagging goo with the sights of his goo-gun. He would not miss again. All it would take is one slip, one simple mistake and that goo is a fat stack of technocreds with his name on it. Ready\u2026aim\u2026\nThomaseth heard a scream. It broke his concentration and in a split second the goo began to flee. The scream was coming from behind him and getting louder. He could either chase the goo and risk an ambush from behind, or cut his losses and prepare himself for whatever was running closer. Thomaseth smirked for a third time. He knew he had lost one HECK of a bounty but he didn&amp;#39;t care. &amp;quot;Looks like this day just got\u2026interesting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thomaseth did a somersault twist manoeuvre and pointed his goo-gun towards the scream.

Thomaseth sighed.\n&amp;quot;Laramie.&amp;quot; He said. &amp;quot;Fucking Laramie.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laramie Slow-round was a pathetic shell of a man. Pudgy and quite short, he resembled a particularly rotund pile of goo. Beads of sweat poured down his piggy-pig face, and his puffy cheeks were a bright rosey-red. The short sprint to Thomaseth had robbed him of what little breath he could keep in his underdeveloped lungs, and he keeled over to collect himself. Laramie was among the bottom 10 percent of goohunters, surpassing only the women and the disfigured. His aim was dreadful, he could only pull off 10, maybe 20 manoeuvres tops, the goos he did bag were juveniles, and he hardly got any killstreaks at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sight of Laramie repulsed Thomaseth. He had tried in the past to diagnose what exactly was wrong with his corpulent comrade, and he had come to the conclusion that his T-count was dangerously low. On top of this, he suspected that Laramie was cursed with &amp;gt;1% Neanderthal DNA. Laramie&amp;#39;s shortcomings had left him quite feeble, both physically and mentality. His intellect lagged behind: he was a pre-sing mind in a post-sing world (sing means singularity). With him were outdated relics of the past: instead of the standard issue technowatch and EZ-shades, Laramie was equipped with last-gen hardware. His betawatch was little more than a timepiece with an ultranet connection and his obsolete sol-blockers failed to protect his eyes from dangerous goo-rays. What a fucking idiot.
