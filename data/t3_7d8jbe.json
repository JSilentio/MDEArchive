I&amp;#39;ve been a member for over 5 years now, I have about 7,250 posts, and I know a lot about how voting on this website works.  I have a few complaints about the current system, and I also have some suggestions on how to improve upon it, which I will outline below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First let me talk about the importance of Karma.  Many people who have become disenfranchised from reddit have made the claim that Karma is just &amp;quot;feel good internet points&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s so much more than that.  If you make a post to a subreddit with more than 10,000 subscribers, the message you just wrote will reach more people than you will ever meet in your &lt;em&gt;lifetime&lt;/em&gt; (I learned that on Vsauce).  Whether or not that message and idea will ultimately be transmitted to others is based on upvotes and downvotes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all hate getting a downvote on our comments.  It sucks!  It makes you question whether or not your opinion is valid, or whether you should be speaking at all or just keeping your mouth shut.  I&amp;#39;m personally of the opinion that no one should be silenced online or made to feel bad about their thoughts and experiences.   The current system allows for malicious trolls to come in and downvote all sorts of positive, supportive, or otherwise uplifting messages... en-mass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason that I am proposing an upvote/downvote system for reddit users that would influence their ability to upvote / downvote controversial posts.  Please think of my proposal this way... New reddit users (potentially troll accounts made for the purpose of downvoting), start as neurtal.  Their vote can be weighted at or around &amp;#39;1.0&amp;#39;.  Users with many highly-upvoted comments would have a weight associated with their votes that is higher than a 1.0.  A redditor who contributes helpful and valuable content will be able to raise or lower posts with more effectiveness than a brand new user.  This also has the effect of giving new users something to aspire to.  Redditors with unpopular accounts... well, their posts would either have an influence of a fraction of one, or even a negative influence (for the worst offenders, nazis, etc...).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?  I would appriciate any valuable and constructive feedback, as I am a 5th year undergraduate studen working towards a bachelors degree in computer interface &amp;amp; design.  &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey guys, I just wanted to leave some feedback about the karma/voting system here on Reddit.
