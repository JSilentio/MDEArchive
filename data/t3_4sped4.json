The reason he has drawn such a following is his embodiment of all of us. We all share traits with Sam, and this is what drew us and him to the 4chan culture. Sam does what most of us don't have the courage to do, allowing his real and virtual world to combine in the form of MDE.\nSam was born on April 16, 1985, and from the very moment he first gasped air, his raison d'\u00eatre has been comedy. His mother always laughed at toddler Sam's mischiefs around the house. This ultimately affected his life path; Sam was raised into a predefined image stemming from his youthful and innocent vigor. This impacted him greatly, and his sole method of gaining the trust and friendship of others became humor. Sam does not remember his youth fondly, experiencing the divorce of his parents as well as a troubled school life, and would often miss classes or just not pay attention, preferring simply to make his classmates laugh. During his schooling, Sam perfected his ability to play the role of \"class clown,\" though we can see in retrospect that perhaps this facade arose as a defense against the bullying and alienation he experienced in elementary, which might be due to the lack of a father figure. Sam is like most of us in this respect, an 'outsider', but did not drop his guise after it successfully got him through highschool with only minor hiccups.\nTaking on a 40k USD Film major at RISD, and pursuing further study at Carnegie Mellon, Sam still saw a need to protect himself through a constant miasma of insincerity, and this is when the Million Dollar Extreme alter-ego truly came into form. Starting out with film projects for his major, Sam honed his obscure form of humor further, before creating the MDE Youtube channel on Dec 30th, 2007, around the time he finished his postgraduate studies at Carnegie. Sam was living in Pawtucket at this point; not exactly an upper class neighborhood. It would be no understatement to say that Sam's tertiary studies had an impact on the family finances, despite Sam pitching in as much as he could, working as a car salesman with Nick. Sam was not able to find a job with his qualifications despite classmates getting placements at production studios like Nickelodeon, and so his student debt became a looming and increasingly troubling figure over his head. Sam's relationship with his mother was strained at this point, and he became upset with his lot in life.

Sam's fanbase continued to grow, and he fostered his internet presence with a new drive, marketing himself first via mde.tv, which he launched in 2011, and then finally founding the MDE subreddit on December 15th, 2012, all the while releasing more and more content for his fans to enjoy and spread around.

The reason he has drawn such a following is his embodiment of all of us. We all share traits with Sam, and this is what drew us and him to the 4chan culture. Sam does what most of us don&amp;#39;t have the courage to do, allowing his real and virtual world to combine in the form of MDE.\nSam was born on April 16, 1985, and from the very moment he first gasped air, his raison d&amp;#39;\u00eatre has been comedy. His mother always laughed at toddler Sam&amp;#39;s mischiefs around the house. This ultimately affected his life path; Sam was raised into a predefined image stemming from his youthful and innocent vigor. This impacted him greatly, and his sole method of gaining the trust and friendship of others became humor. Sam does not remember his youth fondly, experiencing the divorce of his parents as well as a troubled school life, and would often miss classes or just not pay attention, preferring simply to make his classmates laugh. During his schooling, Sam perfected his ability to play the role of &amp;quot;class clown,&amp;quot; though we can see in retrospect that perhaps this facade arose as a defense against the bullying and alienation he experienced in elementary, which might be due to the lack of a father figure. Sam is like most of us in this respect, an &amp;#39;outsider&amp;#39;, but did not drop his guise after it successfully got him through highschool with only minor hiccups.\nTaking on a 40k USD Film major at RISD, and pursuing further study at Carnegie Mellon, Sam still saw a need to protect himself through a constant miasma of insincerity, and this is when the Million Dollar Extreme alter-ego truly came into form. Starting out with film projects for his major, Sam honed his obscure form of humor further, before creating the MDE Youtube channel on Dec 30th, 2007, around the time he finished his postgraduate studies at Carnegie. Sam was living in Pawtucket at this point; not exactly an upper class neighborhood. It would be no understatement to say that Sam&amp;#39;s tertiary studies had an impact on the family finances, despite Sam pitching in as much as he could, working as a car salesman with Nick. Sam was not able to find a job with his qualifications despite classmates getting placements at production studios like Nickelodeon, and so his student debt became a looming and increasingly troubling figure over his head. Sam&amp;#39;s relationship with his mother was strained at this point, and he became upset with his lot in life.
