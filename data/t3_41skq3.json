The critiques you list are to an extent valid, but they don&amp;#39;t address the fundamental issue which we two are discussing, which is the heritability of IQ. The fact that IQ is not the definite measure of intelligence or human cognitive ability is correct, but it is nevertheless a pretty good one.
