It&amp;#39;s not as simple as him just choosing to be that way, despite how much you and so many people on this sub like to simplify everything so you can cope with your lack of compassion, he probably has had his fair share of fucked up things happen to him as he was growing up, and probably has shit social skills because of that, or because he has a mental disorder of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no pain worse than loneliness and alienation because regardless of how introverted you are, humanity relies of socializing to survive, and this guy is feeling like killing himself because of it. To a certain extent, we should strive to be more independent when it comes to living and being able to make a decent living, but plenty of people are in such a shit situation that they need others to help them out in some way. Prolonged isolation will completely tear anyone apart, and you&amp;#39;ll find that what little social skills you had before will slowly erode away the longer it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also empathy is a word that works entirely, empathy is the understanding and feeling of another person&amp;#39;s pain. You wanna know what makes you such an autist? the fact that you have little to no empathy for what this guy is going through, you can&amp;#39;t for one second put yourself in this persons shoes and try to get some understanding of what he&amp;#39;s feeling. The moment you said that he should literally kill himself is when you showed yourself to be a complete sociopath sack of shit, you&amp;#39;re probably not a very fun person to talk to or hang out with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: And for fucks sake I was never asking anyone to personally help the guy, I&amp;#39;m just saying that it&amp;#39;s much better to have an understanding of what the dude is going through rather than saying &amp;quot;Oh man this guy needs to kill himself so he doesn&amp;#39;t leech off society&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5bkjhf/i_always_dreamed_of_being_a_successful_game/d9pcxoo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_d9pcxoo", "created": 1478539493.0, "author_flair_text": "Courtney Love shot tupac", "created_utc": 1478510693.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d9pbz26", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "motorparty", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_d9paxwy", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Compassion, is the word youre looking for, not empathy.
