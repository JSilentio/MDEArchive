Sex is a topic that is a neverending source of comedy, drama, action, horror and adventure. Sex is never vanilla. If you are a female, you\u2019re must mention you\u2019re a sub. Either way, a good sex story must include at least two of the following: anal, BDSM, threesomes, humorous mixup, and some kind of a toy.

You\u2019re relatable so you procrastinate but you love science. Sometimes you google things and then explain them to others. If that\u2019s too difficult you can just say that space is really huge. It blows your mind, because you\u2019re very thoughtful that way.\nYou of course love to read books. Harry Potter and How To Make Friends and Influence People completely changed your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although you\u2019re of above average intelligence you also know how unimportant and insignificant we all are but you cope with it with healthy positive attitude.

You know a lot about psychology in general. You can easily diagnose problems of complete strangers and offer solutions such as seeing a therapist or working out. You have saved many lives by offering people to pm you if they need to talk and linking suicide hotlines.\nAnd altruistic person like yourself always wants to give back to the community by giving advice. You went through weightloss so you would be happy to talk more about that journey and discipline you obtained. Sometimes you see people mention a girl that they like. You are happy when that happens because then you can tell them to just go ask her out because what\u2019s the worse that can happen, they\u2019\u2019ll get rejected? That builds character. You\u2019re really into self improvement. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to get motivated though but that\u2019s the difference between motivation and discipline. You like to blow people\u2019s minds.
