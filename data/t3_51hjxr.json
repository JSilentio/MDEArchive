It keeps me from getting into a procrastination rut, and basically keeps me sane since I don't normally leave the house except for school, work, fulfilling promises I've already made, and someone in my family asking me to do something. This doesn't mean completely eschew college for a $10/hr job; It means you should dip your toe in the water while keeping one foot on dry land. \n\n\nBottom line: \n\n * If you aren't doing well, drop to one or two classes a semester that you can get excited about to get you on the ball. \n * Withdraw if you have a D or worse.

It's cheaper and failure is more tolerable. Bonus for this if you can live with your parents/guardian(s) and the college is decent (or even better than 4 year institutions due to the small class size)\n\nNothing I've done in my life has had as lasting an effect as college, distantly followed by work, family, and health. My grades still count, but the other stuff I did or made is all gone, including the time I spent on it. I still have to tolerate schedules and homework, but it's the best way to invest my time by far. \n\n\nI hope this long winded post helps.

Like someone else mentioned, you can get a help desk job pretty much anywhere in the country with minimal knowledge of computer troubleshooting. It's easy to work your way up. I got tired of working with computers and fortunately had another job opportunity arise. I make really good money now with the potential to earn more, and I don't recommend a college degree if you're not into college. Don't force it. If I finished my degree I'd be tapped out around $60-70k a year doing really mundane design work for god knows what kind of shit company.\n\nEven our boy Sam Hyde says college is a waste. Just get your certs up dude.

Like someone else mentioned, you can get a help desk job pretty much anywhere in the country with minimal knowledge of computer troubleshooting. It&amp;#39;s easy to work your way up. I got tired of working with computers and fortunately had another job opportunity arise. I make really good money now with the potential to earn more, and I don&amp;#39;t recommend a college degree if you&amp;#39;re not into college. Don&amp;#39;t force it. If I finished my degree I&amp;#39;d be tapped out around $60-70k a year doing really mundane design work for god knows what kind of shit company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even our boy Sam Hyde says college is a waste.

Its amazing to me how many conscious young men look up to Sam, like I do, and I am even looking up to you guys, and many of you guys are younger than me... and Im a girl... I guess the point of this is I am 25, seriously alternative thinking, fuck society type, and my passion is growing food and earth homes and self sustainability, even though I kick myself daily for not making more progress in these areas I am certain they are my purpose because they are the only solution I have found to setting miserble people free from this soul sucking system. I do not regret for a single second never going to college because i see how these college people live. Completely dependent on oil, and dont give a fuck about anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All my energy is being rerouted to this goal. Its a daily struggle still, rewiring the mind, learning tools of focus and manifestation. I gotta say my man, look at the fucking traffic on the interstate and ask yourself if its really worth keeping these fucking companies running. Look at all the human waste, useless eaters, and psychopaths. I am 100% checked out of that world brother.
