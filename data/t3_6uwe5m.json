I&amp;#39;m currently sitting in a cafe in an undisclosed location in a small Middle America town. That&amp;#39;s a specific I can get... for my safety. I&amp;#39;m living in my car, not staying in one place for more than a few hours. I&amp;#39;ve been on the road for 4 days now, and I&amp;#39;m staring to realize how grim my situation looks. But, as long as I stay a few miles from the nearest pizza place I&amp;#39;m usually safe for a few hours... usually. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now... the first thing I did after I wrote my last post was to try to email sam Gino and apologize. I simply explained how my insecurities and lack of skills or knowledge left me feeling jealous. I explained how I needed an outlet to spew my inadequacies. However... I think it was too late. I instantly received an automated email back saying &amp;quot;the email you have tried reaching does not exist or is no longer in service.&amp;quot; He gave me a chance, and I blew it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I decided I had enough of it. I couldn&amp;#39;t take any more pizza boxes showing up at my house every day filled with grotesque objects. I couldn&amp;#39;t stand the pizza sauce covering the walls of my house every time I stepped outside. Things started getting even worse too. The local dominoes, marios, and papa Gino&amp;#39;s cars would sit outside of my house every night. I could see them taking pictures, planning for the perfect strike where I would finally be taken down for good. I didn&amp;#39;t have the courage to confront them, so I would just hide and prey they would leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, because they knew where I lived, I realized I had to leave. The next morning I got in my car and drove west. I drove and drove for hours until I felt like I was going to give out. Suddenly, just as I was about to fall asleep at the wheel, I realized I was craving a nice, cheesy, crusty, gooey pizza. Since this fiasco started, I had been too scared to even have a slice. However, now that I was out of Papa Gino&amp;#39;s chain range, I figured there would be no harm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went on yelp and found that the nearest pizza place was called &amp;quot;Giovanis family pizza.&amp;quot; I quickly drove to the location only .2 miles away and went inside. I was greeted by a friendly old woman at the counter. She was at least 70 and had the kindest smile that made me feel at home &amp;quot;Hello, sir! Welcome to Giovanni&amp;#39;s family pizza. the oldest family restaurant in town, run only by my husband and I!&amp;quot; I greeted the friendly woman and quickly and ordered a nice slice of pepperoni sausage and a Diet Coke. I waited patiently as she and her husband hand prepared my slice in the back. I decided to take out my phone and read some cool stuff on &lt;a href=\"/r/askreddit\"&gt;r/askreddit&lt;/a&gt; (shoutout my askers!) while I waited. It seemed to be taking suspiciously long. Suddenly, I felt a warm drop on neck. I whirled around only to see that the woman was slowly dropping pizza sauce on me with a large label while simultaneously putting a knife to my neck. She laughed maniacally while I screamed and shoved her as hard as I could. It didn&amp;#39;t seem to phase her as she chased me around the restaurant. I flung the door open and ran back to my car with the lady grinned behind me, still standing in the restaurant. I&amp;#39;m not gona bother with the police. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am now. Maybe five towns over now. Please sam... I know it&amp;#39;s too late and I know you have the power to destroy me... but please.
