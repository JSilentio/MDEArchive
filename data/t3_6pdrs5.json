He&amp;#39;s like the John the Baptist to the great /pol/ack Christ. He refers to the Aryans as cuckold&amp;#39;s often in their relation to the Jew. He even goes into a bit about how much he loves communism (&amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s born French, a natural egalitarian!&amp;#39;), and how he&amp;#39;d love to have a communist system, only without the Jews.

He just spent about 10 pages naming a specific french critic, big in the 30&amp;#39;s, and mercilessly ridiculing his style of writing/praising authors. He also refers to Proust (Jewish) as Poo-Proust (like poo-poo, tee-hee) whenever he mentions him, and has a lot to say about literature, how alcohol is being used on the Fench like the English used Opium on the Chinese, etc. It&amp;#39;s a must-have for any self-respecting anti-semite&amp;#39;s library! It&amp;#39;s an outrage that ultra-famous authors like him, and others, have books like this that just aren&amp;#39;t published or translated and are given the silent treatment.
