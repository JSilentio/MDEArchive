I'd like you to answer that before you start throwing out ad homs. \n\n&gt;will mozart be forbidden in europe in the upcoming years? did non-white migrants destroy any cultural relic in europe so far?\n\nare you aware that in Sweden rape has increased 1400% since they started taking in immigrants from the middle east en masse? Rotherham, they had over 1500 young girls discovered to be raped in child sex operations run by muslim immigrants over 10 years. did you hear about the 1000 sexual attacks that happened in Cologne on NYE? Are you aware that in many cities across Europe there are \"no-go zones\", you must have heard about this, these are places where police do not patrol because they are densely populated with muslim migrants. There's a video of a news reporter in Sweden talking about a muslim community there, they got physically assaulted by like 4 muslim guys, camera rolling, and the cops showed up but didn't do anything about it, it's like the cops are afraid. The police in these countries do not mention the race of a suspect out of fear of leftist backlash and being called a \"racist\", could you imagine that shit happening in the USA? \n\n\"Hey we have a robbery in progress, suspect fled on foot. He's about 6 feet tall wearing a red shirt and white shorts\" , \" Ok, what does he look like?\", \"Well, he's got a partial beard, brown eyes \" , \"OK but what kind of person is he?\" , \"What do you mean what 'kind' of person? human beings are all the same, we're all just one species\", \" yeah but what race is he?\" \"WHAT? race is a social construct! racist!\",\n\n and yet they want you to remember race when it's some kind of cultural heritage celebration, or when they need to remind you of how poorly white people treated their race 100 years ago. All over Europe there are radicalized muslims who push for Sharia law, they immigrated to Europe NOT to learn how to become European, but to take advantage of the wealth and prosperity of Europe, they keep their culture and ideals with them when they moved in, which is why in Paris for example you have huge enclaves of Muslims who do not even speak French and make no attempt to adapt to French life, they had to ban the Burqa because so many women walked around covered up it didn't look like a French city. There are some places in Europe which leftist politicians are pushing to allow child marriages, so when some guy moves to Germany from Afghanistan and brings his 12 year old WIFE, his marriage to her can be legally binding. That's the kind of sick shit I'm talking about. Dude, you really need to spend some time actually watching and reading the news, not mainstream news, but actual news that tells you what's going on for real. Watch Stephan Molyneux's video on muslim migration to Europe, they've increased immigration from muslim countries by millions in the past 10 years, and people like Merkel shame anyone who disagrees with it as racist, she even removed a German flag from a stage she was on because of how guilt ridden she is about her heritage, it's the neurosis of white guilt that tells Europeans to be ashamed of who they are, and what people who look like them did a long time ago. and \"white people\" are the majority tax payer in these countries, and their tax dollars are funding the free housing and welfare given to the muslim migrants who don't even want to learn their language. their poor birth rate should be fixed by letting in a wave of young muslim men to \"fix the problem\", the problem being a white majority according to European leftists. That's the danger with the SJW marxism, they literally hate white culture, what it means to be white, and even though they are all feminist they will partner with the most anti-feminist society on the globe in Islam in order to fight their mutual enemy. It's suicidal, just look at the rise in Islamic terror attacks in the past year. The wikipedia page on 2015 terror attacks explains everything, 95% of all terrorism worldwide is islamic. Even the muslims who have been in Europe for decades are against this new wave of immigrants, because those muslims have integrated and the new migrants coming in are in such numbers that they don't need to assimilate, they can keep their ways and habits with them. And they'll let ANYBODY in, did you hear about the Chinese tourist who lost his wallet, and when he went to report it, the situation got confused and they put him in a refugee camp and gave him money? he was there for 12 DAYS before they fixed it. Imagine if that was an ISIS suicide bomber? he wouldn't need 12 days. \n\n&gt;things are relativity decent only in the last 70 years tops, before that the lives of most people in europe were godawful\n\nLOL WUT? the Renaissance? Beethoven? Gutenberg? Columbus? De Carte? Newton? Voltaire? Einstein? Look at London in 1900 and tell me things were \"Godawful\". the lives of Europeans since the 1700's have been arguably better than anyone on the planet. The Industrial Revolution STARTED in Europe, wealth and prosperity has been the defining characteristic of Europe for like 300 years bro. \"Godawful\" by today's standards, because they didn't have AC and smartphones, but if you had a choice of where to be born anytime in the past few centuries, most people would choose a western European nation. \n\nWhat's really shit about your post though, is your obvious apathy and unwillingness to even defend what is culturally European. are you a liberal? you sound like someone who has no convictions or rationalizations about history, cultural and political history. What would you rather see happen? You don't seem to really care what happens to them, which comes off like you're apathetic towards the entire idea of having a successful, free, capitalist western nation. You speak of 7% of muslims like they DON'T have the power to destroy. Were you under a rock when 130 people got massacred in Paris last year? what about the people who died in Nice? Brussels? Madrid? London? What about the uncounted young women who are sexually assaulted? There are numerous individual murders that don't make global headlines, look closely and you hear about them. And for you to talk about the \"inbred, imbecile south\", you're talking about white people being inbred? There's more incest prevalent in black communities than white, so that's an ironic point to make, and last I checked 50 people in Orlando weren't killed by a white guy this year, that was a Muslim. the 12 cops killed by BlackLiesMatter this year haven't been killed by white people, those were black criminals killing those cops for an ideological cult. \n\nLet me guess, you aren't white. I think that's what I'm getting at, you aren't white, so you are totally clueless about white cultural history and heritage. You have no sense of history with white people, and you probably have actively been brainwashed into being against it because you were told how white people hurt your ancestors in ancient history. White Europeans countries suffering doesn't matter to you because you don't trace yourself back to Europe. Even if you were a black transsexual, the fact that modern life has most if not all of its benefits directly because of what white people invented, discovered and accomplished in the past 300 years, should let in on the knowledge that without a free, white Europe, and by extension the USA, the world may eventually get to a point where the greatest places to live are what we would consider 3rd world today.

They hear \"free trade\" and they think \"free market\", and that's absolutely not the case. There's so much fuckery going on at the international level, multi-national corporations executing the literal exploitation of 3rd world countries' pay gap to the 1st world to make higher profit isn't supposed to be something conservatives are in favor of because it actually hurts their own country. It gives you cheaper goods but less producers to spend money on them. That's a fuzzy divide in right wing thought at the moment I believe, where does adherence to nationalism stop and adherence to free market capitalism begin when some practices that take place in capitalism work to the DETRIMENT of your nation? As far as I'm concerned, you're absolutely right, establishment vs. anti-establishment isn't a left-right issue, people try to make it out to be but again you are correct, this election has shown that what used to be considered establishment 10 years ago, conservatism, is now anti-establishment as the leftists have become the establishment in Clinton. Bernie vs. Trump would have been a great election. That way we know whoever won, the people running the great scam would have been shaken up pretty badly in the end. \n\nI personally dislike Trump, I think he's a bombastic personality who is lacking the tack, maturity and character to be a good POTUS, but I am fully cognizant of Hillary Clinton's bullshit and in no way would I ever vote for her. I do support some of what Trump wants to do such as abolish some free trade agreements, but based on some of the things that comes out of his mouth I think he's shot himself in the foot in the general and I don't believe he can win given the huge number of women who are voting for Clinton no matter what because she has a vag just like they do! and women don't really think that deep into things, so it's predictable where that's going.

They hear &amp;quot;free trade&amp;quot; and they think &amp;quot;free market&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s absolutely not the case. There&amp;#39;s so much fuckery going on at the international level, multi-national corporations executing the literal exploitation of 3rd world countries&amp;#39; pay gap to the 1st world to make higher profit isn&amp;#39;t supposed to be something conservatives are in favor of because it actually hurts their own country. It gives you cheaper goods but less producers to spend money on them. That&amp;#39;s a fuzzy divide in right wing thought at the moment I believe, where does adherence to nationalism stop and adherence to free market capitalism begin when some practices that take place in capitalism work to the DETRIMENT of your nation? As far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, you&amp;#39;re absolutely right, establishment vs. anti-establishment isn&amp;#39;t a left-right issue, people try to make it out to be but again you are correct, this election has shown that what used to be considered establishment 10 years ago, conservatism, is now anti-establishment as the leftists have become the establishment in Clinton. Bernie vs. Trump would have been a great election. That way we know whoever won, the people running the great scam would have been shaken up pretty badly in the end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally dislike Trump, I think he&amp;#39;s a bombastic personality who is lacking the tack, maturity and character to be a good POTUS, but I am fully cognizant of Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s bullshit and in no way would I ever vote for her. I do support some of what Trump wants to do such as abolish some free trade agreements, but based on some of the things that comes out of his mouth I think he&amp;#39;s shot himself in the foot in the general and I don&amp;#39;t believe he can win given the huge number of women who are voting for Clinton no matter what because she has a vag just like they do! and women don&amp;#39;t really think that deep into things, so it&amp;#39;s predictable where that&amp;#39;s going.

It's worse now than it was in France during the French Revolution, then the richest 3% owned 30% of all the wealth, now it's more like the top 0.1% own 40% of all the wealth.\n\nI am not a marxist/communist, but I am a left leaning libertarian. Left in the classical sense, not the modern SJW communist marxist bullshit sense. I want the system to work for everyone in such a way that everyone still owns their own private property, yet opportunity exists for people who want to succeed, right now it's hard to succeed even with hard work because the 1%, large corporations and the government all conspire to keep a monopoly on power, big companies love the government because they have the lawyers and accountants to help them navigate all the regulation and bullshit that their potential rivals and competition cant.  I want a system that works so well people don't even think about instituting some kind of marxist takeover. That's the reason there are so many people who are willing to make state power much stronger, because they have nothing to lose, they are making the equivalent of $3/hour 20 years ago and see nothing wrong with trying to make the system work for them for a change. You emulate the Swiss model, have government regulated health insurance but keep it owned by private companies, but unlike Obamacare, actually enforce the regulation so companies are FORCED, not \"given the option to\", to COMPETE with each other. Privatize failing public schools and have them compete with other schools for government issued vouchers to parents to decide which school their child goes to.

The middle class has shrunken to its lowest level since the Great Depression. Income and wealth inequality is at its greatest point since the Great Depression. It&amp;#39;s worse now than it was in France during the French Revolution, then the richest 3% owned 30% of all the wealth, now it&amp;#39;s more like the top 0.1% own 40% of all the wealth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a marxist/communist, but I am a left leaning libertarian. Left in the classical sense, not the modern SJW communist marxist bullshit sense. I want the system to work for everyone in such a way that everyone still owns their own private property, yet opportunity exists for people who want to succeed, right now it&amp;#39;s hard to succeed even with hard work because the 1%, large corporations and the government all conspire to keep a monopoly on power, big companies love the government because they have the lawyers and accountants to help them navigate all the regulation and bullshit that their potential rivals and competition cant.  I want a system that works so well people don&amp;#39;t even think about instituting some kind of marxist takeover. That&amp;#39;s the reason there are so many people who are willing to make state power much stronger, because they have nothing to lose, they are making the equivalent of $3/hour 20 years ago and see nothing wrong with trying to make the system work for them for a change. You emulate the Swiss model, have government regulated health insurance but keep it owned by private companies, but unlike Obamacare, actually enforce the regulation so companies are FORCED, not &amp;quot;given the option to&amp;quot;, to COMPETE with each other. Privatize failing public schools and have them compete with other schools for government issued vouchers to parents to decide which school their child goes to.
