From what I've heard, the show itself was fairly warmly received by Adult Swim fans and charted decent ratings, but the decision to cancel the show was driven by outside influence (articles on Buzzfeed and related sites that attacked the political views of the creators).\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that caving into those website's demands is the wrong thing to do, plain and simple. The show itself may have attacked some social norms, but it was hardy an \"Alt-Right\" program, as it has been described by the sites in question. Those claims are ridiculous. Perhaps the creators of the show have some right of center positions, but to cancel a TV show because of the political opinions the creator holds is, I would say, downright un-american.\n&gt; \n&gt; All I can say is: how many viewers will you lose due to the cancellation? I would wager thousands, possibly even tens of thousands, myself included. What would you lose by keeping it on the air? Nothing. The ones driving the cancellation are more than likely not even viewers of Adult Swim; and if they are, they won't \"boycott\" the network if the show remains. \n&gt; \n&gt; I can, however, all but guarantee that if you decide to kill the show solely as a result of the creators holding political opinions that lean right, you will lose viewers.

From what I&amp;#39;ve heard, the show itself was fairly warmly received by Adult Swim fans and charted decent ratings, but the decision to cancel the show was driven by outside influence (articles on Buzzfeed and related sites that attacked the political views of the creators).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that caving into those website&amp;#39;s demands is the wrong thing to do, plain and simple. The show itself may have attacked some social norms, but it was hardy an &amp;quot;Alt-Right&amp;quot; program, as it has been described by the sites in question. Those claims are ridiculous. Perhaps the creators of the show have some right of center positions, but to cancel a TV show because of the political opinions the creator holds is, I would say, downright un-american.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can say is: how many viewers will you lose due to the cancellation? I would wager thousands, possibly even tens of thousands, myself included. What would you lose by keeping it on the air? Nothing. The ones driving the cancellation are more than likely not even viewers of Adult Swim; and if they are, they won&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;boycott&amp;quot; the network if the show remains. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can, however, all but guarantee that if you decide to kill the show solely as a result of the creators holding political opinions that lean right, you will lose viewers.
