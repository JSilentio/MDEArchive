A lot of monasteries of other practices do the same thing (free room / board) \n\nWhere did I claim that? \n\nAnd TM isn't a religion.\n\nThat is, you can be a [world-famous Roman Catholic Priest](http://www.claret.org/en/news/03-01-2010/gabriel-mejia-cmf-archbishop-romero-prize-2008) and\n\n1) practice [Yogic Flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkh7hYpSbCg) (which is a prerequisit for being)\n\n2) [be a TM teacher](http://teachertraining.tm.org/)\n\n3) [teach TM to all 5,000 orphans in your orphanages](http://www.fundacionhogaresclaret.org/index.php/meditacion-trascendental)\n\n4) [have all the older kids learn Yogic Flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6daNyp884Po) and require all 800 of your staff to practice as well\n\nand still be a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nIn other words, if Father Mejia wanted to partake of that $700/month room and board, he could ([of course, as an invited speaker at the TM university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqJJzgWTbkc), he likely gets VIP accommodations)\n\nThis is, by the way, an austerity measure on the part of the University. They used to offer $800 cash, then $700 cash, but donations apparently have reduced over time as prospective donors found more \"hop\" for their buck by donating for Yogic Flyers in countries with a lower cost of living.\n\nFor example, [at this All-Buddhist Girl's Boarding School in Thailand](http://lindaegenes.com/light-compassion-buddhist-nuns-thailand-transforming-risk-girls-award-winning-students-help-tm-technique/), where the principal is a TM teacher, the $700 that would keep one Yogic Flyer hopping in the USA will pay for all the academic needs of 14 girls, and so, insomuch as a potentially enlightened participant is potentially enlightened regardless of age or nationality, and group meditation for world peace is needed in every country, many people now donate to the [Dhammajarinee Witthaya School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RPUTz3wj-o) to boost THEIR yogic flying numbers.\n\n\nIf the principal or any other Yogic Flyer from the school wanted to visit, they too could partake of the free room and board.\n\nSame would be true of any atheists.
