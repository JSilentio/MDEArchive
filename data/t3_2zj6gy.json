Listen kid -- I need ya. I need ya on my team. I&amp;#39;ve seen what you can do on the computer.  That&amp;#39;s a -- that&amp;#39;s a video &amp;#39;cause um, you&amp;#39;re all -- everybody has computer skills, and uh, you know, your parents, when you&amp;#39;re young and you&amp;#39;re playing fucking Pokemon Red, and you&amp;#39;re blowing your mom and dad&amp;#39;s mind with how &amp;quot;he saved the file!

Let&amp;#39;s just say that. You don&amp;#39;t have--every job. Everything is above your pay grade! You&amp;#39;re qualified to operate a vacuum, and it&amp;#39;s just funny that your parents had such high hopes for you based on some fucking piece of shit you made in Photoshop; you put on difference clouds and a lens flare, and your dad was so blown away it was like he was on wires in a movie, he went &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;PWOOSH&lt;/em&gt; Woah, my son&amp;#39;s a computer genius!

You know, you spend $30,000, $35,000 a year on rent and food and upkeep, you&amp;#39;re not left with much. You&amp;#39;re not left with much at all. Is it really worth it?
