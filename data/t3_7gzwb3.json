If anything I hear them speed up, I can feel the drivers clench the steering wheels and push down hard on the accelerator, the drone of the engines filling my ears, adding to the symphony of screams and metallic noise that screeches incessantly in my head. I&amp;#39;m shaking now, the pressure just below my skin growing, my skull about to pop, so that finally all that pressure and noise will be released, and I can finally breathe again. But instead the pressure just holds, and my face becomes redder and redder with insanity, the cars still speeding right by me either side, just inches away. I start to spin in circles, waving my arms wildly, waving my entire torso, snapping my spine back and forth. No one takes any notice of the hair that&amp;#39;s beginning to fall from my head, it was already thin but now it falls down to my feet, onto the wet pavement, but some of it sticks to my boots, until just a few wisps remain, not even connected but just matted down by the rain. And my eyes, bloodshot and red, bulge out of their sockets and start twitching, I feel the veins pulsing on their sides, and I can&amp;#39;t really see the cars any more, even though I know they&amp;#39;re there, because I can still feel them rushing by me, the wind blowing by my hands. My teeth grind and I open my mouth wide, like a snake, until my jaw muscles stretch as far as they will, and I snap it shut again and grind my teeth some more, now my head bobbles on my neck, rolling around back and forth in circles, while my spine still contorts and my arms wave, outstretched, to the cars speeding just inches around me, past me in the middle of the road. I cannot moan, or scream, I lose control of my body entirely, my shirt is too tight around my neck and sweat seeps through, hot, with the rain. The drone and metallic noise, clanging, engines, screaming, one noise, incessant, louder than any of these cars, and I&amp;#39;m writhing on my feet, folding over, everything compressed, waiting to be broken free, one push to burst, expanding air and blood between my skin and bones, everything cracks, every joint grinds in place, no peace, I cannot scream, I want to scream, and that thought, I want to scream, shuts my eyes up tight, and I shake harder and harder in place, the cars speed by, the drivers do not look, their knuckles white on the steering wheels, feet on the accelerators, no one looks, I cannot be seen, do not see me, do not scream. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until now, I&amp;#39;m floating wide in space, open, and utterly relieved, and my breath rushes free from my lungs, from my mouth, into open air.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I run into the street.
