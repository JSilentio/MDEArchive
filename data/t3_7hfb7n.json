The wisdom of a thousand years doesn\u2019t come lightly. It\u2019s not something you want. Because a little bit of experience is like a patina on a bronze statue. It\u2019s real nice-looking. A little bit of experience is like the way Beck dresses. The musical artist Beck. The way he dresses. That\u2019s what a little bit of life experience will do to you. And you can impress people, and it\u2019s nice-looking. At parties, you can whip out your life experience, and really talk a big game. But, just like shit that collects on a statue, if you have too much life experience, you\u2019re like- what\u2019s that porn? Crackwhore Confessions? What\u2019s the one where they get crackwhores and they fuck \u2018em? That\u2019s what you turn into. That\u2019s what happens when you go overboard. You know, everything in moderation, including wisdom and experience. Otherwise you\u2019re just a fuckhole. Life boils you down into a fuckhole. And it\u2019s not \u2018cause you\u2019re dumb or you made bad moves, it\u2019s just, that\u2019s what happens when enough stuff happens to you. It\u2019s not like World of Warcraft where you reach level sixty and you\u2019re a god and you get pussy all day. \u2018cause when you get a level sixty character in WoW, you get so much pussy that your dick is just red and chafed all the time. You know, like when Blizzard resets the ladder and you make a Javazon and you get to level ninety-one the fastest and you get to level ninety-nine the fastest and girls are just dropping their pants left and right to fuck you because they want to give you their babies, and they want you to fill them up. They want you to fill \u2018em up. Wanna get filled up? But life, you kinda get up to- maybe this is just a guess, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m stupid. But, you get up to like level fifty and then it\u2019s all downhill. And then, you know, as you progress, as you gain skills, you just keep getting fucked, and like bums are fucking you in the mouth. Bums are cumming in you. You become a bum cum dumpster. You become a bum cum bucket. You become cum. So yeah, what I was thinking was, I was thinking about like, these girls, and guys too, who go to nice colleges, a nice Boston college, a nice college in Boston. \u2018I think I should go to a college in Boston.\u2019 You know, these olive-green-colored colleges. \u2018I\u2019ll go to a place where there\u2019s a lot of olive-green brick. Point me in that direction. I\u2019ll go to Wesleyan. I\u2019ll go to Wesleyan for a few years, fuck it. I\u2019m not paying for it.\u2019 And they have this, like- you tend to find a lot of reverence for William S. Burroughs, and Charles Bukowski, and Hunter S. Thompson. And- I\u2019m not really familiar with those guys\u2019 writings. I know that I did see Naked Lunch and I thought it was really good. That\u2019s William S. Burroughs\u2019s- that\u2019s based on a book by him or something. But, all these guys have this kinda like, this like, Bob Dylan sixties pop folk wisdom. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s based on Walt Whitman, who\u2019s another person that I haven\u2019t read anything by, but I get it. I get what they\u2019re- I get the point. So there\u2019s all these people-these young people-people my age, people twenty-two-years-old to my age, people twenty-one-years-old to my age, walking around, and they\u2019re- and they think that it\u2019s all- they think that life is like a movie and the intro to the movie goes like this: \u2018So you want wisdom, kid? Well, alright. I got one piece of wisdom for you. I got one piece of wisdom for you, kid. Life comes at you 150 miles an hour, smokin\u2019 cigarettes, and it doesn\u2019t pull any punches. So when you\u2019re livin\u2019, you live it, kid.\u2019 That\u2019s the takeaway; that\u2019s what I get from what I can see of those authors. That\u2019s what I feel like-forgive me if I\u2019m mistaken-that\u2019s what I feel like the jist of all that stuff is. It\u2019s kinda like, it\u2019s kinda like Catcher in the Rye, which I did read, I did read that book, \u2018cause it was, you know- hey, it\u2019s a good book. And it\u2019s high school required reading. But it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like that, only less depressing, more optimistic, more throw-it-all-against-the-wall, and just \u2018do it \u2018cause it feels good and you got no other choice\u2019. And so all that- all these people are walking around and they think the whole point of life is, \u2018Kid, let me give you one piece of advice. When you get to be my age, you count the days by the shots of Jim Bean you done. Ridin\u2019 your motorcycle- there\u2019s nothin\u2019 like ridin\u2019 a British motorcycle as fast as you can, the wind in your hair; there\u2019s nothin\u2019 like it. Kid, you know what? When you\u2019re livin\u2019 it, you\u2019re doin\u2019 it, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I\u2019m Bob Dylan.\u2019 And, first of all, sidenote, let me just point out that that is a more advanced variant of stripper knowledge, stripper wisdom, twenty-eight-year-old stripper with a son named Jayden, her wisdom, which is a tattoo that is on her foot, that says, \u2018Live, laugh, love\u2019. Which is also something that I think Lil Wayne has said. So, you, you pseudo-intellectual people, young people, with a lot of knit wool clothing, wool caps, wool- a nice scarf, you got your iPod, you got an iPod case, you have your nice songs on your iPod, just know that your wisdom is a more advanced version, different clothes version, of Jade the stripper, and her foot tattoo that says, \u2018Live, laugh, love\u2019. But, what I was also thinking about, and I think I\u2019ve talked about this before, but this is something that I talk about with Nick a lot, and that is that, if you haven\u2019t had- if you haven\u2019t had some sort of trauma in your life, you\u2019re probably a bad person. And, I think that\u2019s- well- I think- hm. You can\u2019t say that trauma always makes you into a good person, but all these people who have this kind of bubble-gum, care-free existence, you know even though it\u2019s dressed up in a J. Crew catalogue it\u2019s still bubble-gum, all these people, the one common thread is that they have not had major life trauma. I might be wrong about that. I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s kinda what I feel like. Because I was just looking at this guy on YouTube, I mean on Facebook, this person that I\u2019ve- that I kinda know who he is, but I don\u2019t- I\u2019m not friends with him or anything, but he was a pole-vaulter in high school, and he broke his back. And for the past ten years, he\u2019s been in a wheelchair. You know, handsome guy, kinda built like Charls Carroll, like a very lean, but robust- like a, you know. Like a little mini warrior build, he had that. He had a nice build. He had a handsome face. And he broke his back. And he\u2019s been in a wheelchair for ten years. And he decided that his change- the big shift in his life that was gonna get him back up on his feet was becoming an artist. And the way he did that was- he made- he took photographs, and did Illustrator, Adobe Illustrator vector tracings of the photographs, and printed out stencils, and did big, acrylic paintings using those stencils. With expensive materials, expensive canvases. They look- hey, they look okay, but still, you\u2019re doing- you\u2019re taking computer tracings and using stencils, and that\u2019s what life is. That\u2019s what is waiting for you, under the rafters. In-between the bleachers. You know, you\u2019re having fun, you\u2019re watching the game, you\u2019re watching the varsity game, but there\u2019s a child molester under the bleachers, and he\u2019s gonna grab your penis or your vagina and pull on it really hard, and you\u2019ll be screaming but no one will notice you screaming because they\u2019re all enjoying the game. I just thought of that. And that\u2019s pretty true. That\u2019s pretty much what is gonna happen. You know, life- not necessarily reptilian Illuminati, but, the mechanisms of control, the system, the gears, that I- I don\u2019t believe in, you know, too much conspiracy theory; I think that a lot of this stuff is organic. I think it\u2019s just, you know, you put ten people in a room and systems emerge. But these systems, they are going to seek to control you and fuck your life up at any chance you can give it. Any time you get a speeding ticket, any time you get a little thing. And it\u2019s always- if you\u2019re middle-class and you get two speeding tickets that\u2019s fine. I mean, it\u2019s a hassle. You probably- if you\u2019re in Connecticut you have to go to driver-retraining. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. But if you\u2019re lower-middle class and you get three speeding tickets? If you\u2019re- if you make 25,000 a year- if you make 34,000, if you make the average American median income and you get four speeding tickets? Like that could be like the beginning of the end. Like that could be the part of your life where it starts to get real fucked up. That day that you get the fourth speeding ticket, you might look back at that fifteen years later, and realize, \u2018Wow, my life turned into a piece of shit because I got a fourth speeding ticket.\u2019 So, just be ready for that. And, you know. Just- finish watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; it\u2019s a good movie. But when that\u2019s done, wake up. And watch Patriot Games. Because Patriot Games is a lot more realistic.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\u201cSam, let me talk to you for a second.
