Unsurprisingly, they had already hung ten infidels this morning. He recognized his friend and made sure to spit on him to give the appeal that he didn\u2019t like him but in his mind it was an honorary spit. You see, Jeeves wasn\u2019t a Muslim despite having a Muslim last name, in fact, he was a God-fearing Christian with the true last name of Petit. Jeeves however did not want to end up like his friends so he made sure to follow the name rules and wear the scratchy Muslim garb when he was around any real Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeeves and his mother came to town to sell goats. They had about fifty of them. It was a sure good thing the Madiq\u2019s were goat farmers before the refugees arrived Jeeves\u2019 father always tells him. When word got out that the goats were arriving, many Muslim men in their best ceremonial attire came dancing out of the alleyways with particularly shiny imported Scimitars. Their swift hops and flailing of arms amazed Jeeves every time he saw their display. They all lined up in front of Jeeves and stood like erect soldiers awaiting orders. With their money in hand, Jeeves ran down the line of men with delight as he took the stinky bills from each man\u2019s hand. Like clockwork, the men went to the goat with their designated number and with one swift stroke of the blade cut the goat heads off there in town square. While Jeeves\u2019 mother turned away, Jeeves enjoyed the show. A goat has much more blood then one might think and when their heads are severed in just the right way, it can create a spectacle like no other. Jeeves always wished he could run through the town square and feel the warm goat blood squirt on him quite like the sprinkler he had back at home but of course, mother forbade him. When the goats twitched no more the Muslim men dragged the carcasses out of the square and to their BBQ pits. Jeeves had the job of mixing the top sand to the bottom to keep the town square civil. While Jeeves was finishing up, he spotted a man walking off with his goat that was still alive. It wasn\u2019t weird to Jeeves however because he was told by the men that some people wait to eat their goats and in the meantime take great care of them goats. Jeeves was told that some goats were treated better than their many wives were and Jeeves believed that because once he saw a plump Muslim man go into his shed with the goat and not come out until morning. Jeeves was sure that the man was comforting the goat until its final hour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On their way home Jeeves\u2019 mother was stopped by a group of misshapen Muslim men who asked politely if they could rape her for being out alone. Jeeves popped out from behind his mother with a great big smile and the Muslim men laughed, gave heart spoken apologizes, and were on their way to the next woman traveling alone. It\u2019s said that the wandering Muslim men will only rape women if they are alone and will never mess with a women even if she is traveling with a small, frail boy with a congenital developmental disorder such as autism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Short story set in the near future.
