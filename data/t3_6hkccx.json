Good and Evil are human inventions, born of human foolery, narrowness, and short-sightedness. The organic brain is far too small and too contemptible, to COMPLETELY comprehend what nature is driving at. What appears to be wrong to us, may be right in nature, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can no more establish an infallible system of ethics, than we can establish infallible systems of religion, philosophy or politics. All the Universe is in a state of flux, and men are but a swarm of querulous, heat-evolved insectivores, living aimlessly on the top of a floating cork, that whirls and darts and rolls over and over and over; amid the scum and froth and slime of a boiling, bubbling Alembic. Within his own sphere individual man is, and ought to be the supreme determinant. Outside of that sphere he knows absolutely nothing \u2014 and philosophy LESS THAN NOTHING. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Victory sanctifies. In the realm of abstract Ethics there is no other Fact upon which the plain man can finally make up his mind. As far as Sociology is concerned, ethical principles are decided by the shock of contending armies. Right has always been emblazoned on the standards of Victory, and wrong on the draggled rags of Lost Causes. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6hkccx/what_are_some_of_the_most_profound_passages_in/diz7h64/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_diz7h64", "created": 1497634922.0, "author_flair_text": "Socialism is the Flat Earth theory of economics", "created_utc": 1497606122.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6hkccx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dizebtn", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lm9231", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_6hkccx", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "\"So use all that is called Fortune.
