Like all handlers, he will have been taken from the outside ruins. Their versatility makes them useful, and they are willing to perform distasteful functions in return for food and comfort. This creature has few mechanical appliances, but his body is covered with an insulating clothing, and he carries a bag of instruments around his shoulder.

A panel of the cradle is removed, then tools and artefacts are brought out of the handler\u2019s bag and fixed into the mysterious innards of the machine. It all takes place out of Zucc\u2019s sight. The inside of the cradle is something he has never seen and has no wish to see. All he perceives is the hairy top of the handler\u2019s head as he bows over his work, making a humming noise with his lips and teeth, a noise that Zucc surmises passes for music.\nThe experience is too much. Zucc blasts some narcotic into his vein and drifts into a more pleasant substitute world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is roused by a loud slam, as the panel in his cradle is rammed home. The handler says two brief words to him. The first denotes work done, and the second is a mode of address, basically respectful but which, Zucc suspects, has now become a term of amusement and mild mockery amongst the handlers.\nZucc dismisses the man, having first endorsed his identity chip to say that the work has been done.\nZucc is alone once more, fully functioning, and can continue his day\u2019s reverie. Someday humanity will not need these grotesque throwbacks to primitive man. There will be a better method than the present mechanical contrivances: a system that lives, grows and repairs itself.
