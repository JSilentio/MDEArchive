Don\u2019t think I can see you in my rear-view mirror? HUH? I can see you... How\u2019s my driving, you pasty fuck? Read the number, you little bitch. I dare you. Read the number and shake your stupid fat, round head; dial the number, call and complain.  I dare you. Tell them everything.  Tell them I wiped my ass with a Snickers wrapper and threw that shit-smeared piece of trash onto your windshield. Tell them how you\u2019re eyes lit up with fear and your passenger threw up all down their shirt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell them everything.  I hate this fucking job, you little bitch, I ain\u2019t got nothing to lose. You think I\u2019m kidding? Watch this: double-middle finger, fuckface. That\u2019s right. I am hauling 200 gallons of organic soy-milk with no hands on the mother-fucking wheel. That\u2019s how little I care about this job. That\u2019s how little I care about this dumb fucking world and everything in it\u2014especially your little bitch ass.  You thought you were gonna have a pleasant drive up north with your family.

Well now they have you ugly little fuck.  I\u2019m going to make sure they remember this moment forever.  I am going to make sure your children remember me choking up a $5 breakfast I buried under 3 Redbulls. That\u2019s how deep down I\u2019m going here. I\u2019m going to give your ugly fucking car a new paint-job courtesy of soggy bread, wet eggs, under-cooked bacon, and caffeinated nitric acid.  You\u2019re going to regret ever buying that goddamn ugly car. You are going to regret ever getting your goddamn driving permit. You are going to regret taking the fucking training wheels off your stupid little baby bicycle that daddy bought you.  You\u2019re going to regret even being born you little insignificant little fuck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I own these roads. I am a god here.  You are nothing: a tourist, a nuisance, a leech.   I wish death upon you and so much worse. I wish eternal suffering and damnation upon you and you spawn.  There\u2019s nothing I want more than THIS.  So, go ahead, motherfucker, make the call.  Let the phone operator know just exactly how bad my driving is.  Squint nice and hard through those thick-lensed specs and dribble out my license plate number through the receiver. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See if I care, you little bitch.  Trust me.
