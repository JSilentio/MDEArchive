I\u00a0built houses and planted\u00a0vineyards for myself.\u00a05\u00a0I made myself\u00a0gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.\u00a06\u00a0I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.\u00a07\u00a0I bought male and female slaves, and had\u00a0slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of\u00a0herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.\u00a08\u00a0I also gathered for myself silver and\u00a0gold and the treasure of\u00a0kings and\u00a0provinces. I got\u00a0singers, both men and women, and many\u00a0concubines, the delight of the sons of man.\n\n9\u00a0So I became great and\u00a0surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my\u00a0wisdom remained with me.\u00a010\u00a0And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart\u00a0found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my\u00a0reward for all my toil.\u00a011\u00a0Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was\u00a0vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing\u00a0to be gained under the sun.\n\nThe Vanity of Living Wisely\n\n12\u00a0So I turned to consider\u00a0wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only\u00a0what has already been done.\u00a013\u00a0Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.\u00a014\u00a0The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the\u00a0same event happens to all of them.15\u00a0Then I said in my heart,\u00a0\u201cWhat happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?\u201d And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.\u00a016\u00a0For of the wise as of the fool there is\u00a0no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten.\u00a0How the wise dies just like the fool!\u00a017\u00a0So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for\u00a0all is vanity and a striving after wind.\n\nThe Vanity of Toil\n\n18\u00a0I hated\u00a0all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must\u00a0leave it to the man who will come after me,\u00a019\u00a0and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.20\u00a0So I\u00a0turned about and gave my heart up to despair\u00a0over all the toil of my labors under the sun,\u00a021\u00a0because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.\u00a022\u00a0What has a man from\u00a0all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?\u00a023\u00a0For\u00a0all his days are full of sorrow, and his\u00a0work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.\n\n24\u00a0There is nothing better for a person than that he should\u00a0eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is\u00a0from the hand of God,\u00a025\u00a0for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?26\u00a0For to the one who pleases him\u00a0God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given\u00a0the business of gathering and collecting,\u00a0only to give to one who pleases God.\u00a0This also is vanity and a striving after wind.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vanity of Self-Indulgence&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1\u00a0I\u00a0said in my heart, \u201cCome now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.\u201d But behold, this also was vanity. \u00a02\u00a0I\u00a0said of laughter, \u201cIt is mad,\u201d and of pleasure, \u201cWhat use is it?\u201d\u00a03\u00a0I\u00a0searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine\u2014my heart still guiding me with wisdom\u2014and how to lay hold on\u00a0folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.\u00a04\u00a0I made great works. I\u00a0built houses and planted\u00a0vineyards for myself.\u00a05\u00a0I made myself\u00a0gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.\u00a06\u00a0I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.\u00a07\u00a0I bought male and female slaves, and had\u00a0slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of\u00a0herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.\u00a08\u00a0I also gathered for myself silver and\u00a0gold and the treasure of\u00a0kings and\u00a0provinces. I got\u00a0singers, both men and women, and many\u00a0concubines, the delight of the sons of man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9\u00a0So I became great and\u00a0surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my\u00a0wisdom remained with me.\u00a010\u00a0And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart\u00a0found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my\u00a0reward for all my toil.\u00a011\u00a0Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was\u00a0vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing\u00a0to be gained under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Vanity of Living Wisely&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12\u00a0So I turned to consider\u00a0wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only\u00a0what has already been done.\u00a013\u00a0Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.\u00a014\u00a0The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the\u00a0same event happens to all of them.15\u00a0Then I said in my heart,\u00a0\u201cWhat happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?\u201d And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.\u00a016\u00a0For of the wise as of the fool there is\u00a0no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten.\u00a0How the wise dies just like the fool!\u00a017\u00a0So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for\u00a0all is vanity and a striving after wind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Vanity of Toil&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18\u00a0I hated\u00a0all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must\u00a0leave it to the man who will come after me,\u00a019\u00a0and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.20\u00a0So I\u00a0turned about and gave my heart up to despair\u00a0over all the toil of my labors under the sun,\u00a021\u00a0because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.\u00a022\u00a0What has a man from\u00a0all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?\u00a023\u00a0For\u00a0all his days are full of sorrow, and his\u00a0work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24\u00a0There is nothing better for a person than that he should\u00a0eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil.
