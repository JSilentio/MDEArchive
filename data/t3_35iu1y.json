What he's saying is, you would never be able to design (from scratch) a Buick Park Avenue by yourself. People do not create \t\tproduction quality consumer cars by themselves. Sam then says that you need to jump through a bunch of hoops to even be offered the opportunity to be part of designing something that will be massed produced like that.\n\n3.
