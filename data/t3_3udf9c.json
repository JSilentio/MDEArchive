How are colleges supposed to get money if not by students? By the government maybe? Well then how's the goverment supposed to get more money? Taxing us more on other stuff? Taking money from other necessities? People never think this shit through when claiming we need to cut costs on something. They almost never explain where we get the money for that thing when cutting off the normal supply. Maybe you think colleges don't need funding because they don't actually produce a product or something so they don't really spend any money. If so, just think about the sheer amount of people that need to get paid to provide over 10,000 undergrads or so with an education. Just think about the sheer amount of buildings needed to feed, house, and teach those undergrads and the amount of electricity and water those buildings use. How the hell is a \"free college\" supposed to get that?\n\n&gt;The only thing that should be requried is that you score high enough on an aptitute test for your desired subject, and all subjects which are useful should be free, and give admission to everyone who scores high enough on the IQ test.\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this shit. First of all, a system like this is already kind of in place. Students who excel in high school and on standardized tests can get scholarships and therefore pay less for college than other students. Your point is really ridiculous though because you think doing well on standardized tests is a guarantee of success. I know many people from my highschool who got great scores on standardized tests, great GPAS, and got great scholarships to colleges. Only problem is a lot of those people lacked any sense of duty or direction in life and became enormous potheads and alcoholics so they failed out of college freshman year thus wasting thousands of their parents money. Everyone is flawed and has the potential to change, and young people are especially fickle. Letting the government decide that early on who \"makes it\" to college (and thus in life) is pretty fucked up. Now obviously the problem I described happens already (\"smart\" kids in high school fucking up in college) but at least now it's the responsibility of the kid and their parents because they have to pay for it. Presumably, a parent should know better than the government or college faculty whether their kid is ready for college or not. Under your proposed system, these fuck-ups wouldn't waste any of their money but they would waste the college's money by using up the college's resources and then failing out. Also, standardized tests (including IQ tests) aren't really a good measure of intelligence or anything \"useful\" for that matter. At best they measure how well you can work through years of pointless bullshit so I guess in that sense it can measure your usefulness in society but my point is we shouldn't be praising people or rewarding them for high scores as much as you're proposing we should.\n\n&gt;For example Computer Science would be free, while gender studies or some other horseshit major would cost money, since that is just circlejerking bullshit, closer to entertainment than education.\n\nSo a major that pays a lot of money should be free and a major that pays barely any money should cost money. So where exactly is the motivation for people who want to do \"horseshit\" majors? Won't you just get an influx or morons who don't care about computer science but want to do it because it's the \"useful\" major? Who decides which majors are useful and which ones are pointless bullshit?

The type where you have to move as fast as you can for your entire shift.  I had a part-time job at Fedex as a package handler during peak season.  During a shift I would load an entire 40' long trailer by myself packed from floor to ceiling with heavy boxes.  The part that made it really hard was that I would randomly get \"slammed\" with hundreds of boxes at once coming down the chute forcing me to kick into an even higher gear, to the point where often I spent the entire 5-6 hours running around as fast as I could loading boxes. I only worked there 3 months but after that I went back to school and took 25 credits and it was like easy mode.  Before I used to procrastinate, but since I was taking 25 credits, I knew I didn't have any free time, so I just did homework immediately and I usually got even better grades than before when I procrastinated.\n\nBefore that, school had always been stressful because of homework, procrastination, ect, but from working at fedex I learned that there is no reason to be stressed, it accomplishes nothing except creating more stress.  The only solution is whenever you are stressed because you have too much to do, instead of being stressed, just kick into a higher gear and work harder and harder.\n\nAlso, i've worked a 70 hour week before, but it was an easy job.  I also own my own business.\n\nJust had to write this, because your stupid accusations pissed me off, and you don't know what you are talking about.\n\nIf you need stress to work hard I pity you.

The type where you have to move as fast as you can for your entire shift.  I had a part-time job at Fedex as a package handler during peak season.  During a shift I would load an entire 40&amp;#39; long trailer by myself packed from floor to ceiling with heavy boxes.  The part that made it really hard was that I would randomly get &amp;quot;slammed&amp;quot; with hundreds of boxes at once coming down the chute forcing me to kick into an even higher gear, to the point where often I spent the entire 5-6 hours running around as fast as I could loading boxes. I only worked there 3 months but after that I went back to school and took 25 credits and it was like easy mode.  Before I used to procrastinate, but since I was taking 25 credits, I knew I didn&amp;#39;t have any free time, so I just did homework immediately and I usually got even better grades than before when I procrastinated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before that, school had always been stressful because of homework, procrastination, ect, but from working at fedex I learned that there is no reason to be stressed, it accomplishes nothing except creating more stress.
