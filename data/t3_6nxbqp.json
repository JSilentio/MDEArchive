None of these dipshits know about net neutrality or why big web services like facebook and netflix are pushing it. \n\nNet neutrality forbids ISPs from charging different rates or providing different speeds for different data\nNet neutrality consists of three principles: \n1. No blocking \u2013 you cannot block access to specific content, services, or applications\n2. No throttling \u2013 you cannot impair or degrade lawful internet traffic.\n3. No paid prioritization \u2013 you cannot pay ISPs to provide better internet traffic as compared to others\n\nIf the pipes that make of the internet were a highway, net neutrality would mandate that all of the lanes go the same speed. No passing lines, no HOV lanes, no slow lanes on the right. \n\nServices like google, facebook, and especially netflix make up the vast majority of online data transfers. Its a bigger burden on ISPs when certain companies are taking up so much of the capacity of the pipes through which online data flows. It is sort of like single payer healthcare. Insurance traditionally becomes more expensive the greater risk you or the people in your insurance pool pose. The ISPs just want to be able to say wow, you are causing a greater burden on us because of your volume data flows, we would like to be able to charge you extra for that. These companies do not want it in effect because they don't want to have to pay more for their data than someone running a fantasy dragon dildo storefront that is definitely *not* for use on children. The ISPs want to be able to flex their dicks and provide different options.\n\nThe negative externalities of net neutrality will be picked up by all of the small websites and startups who have bought into (((their))) message. They only see one set of evil corporations in play and its the one that has the fewest trans black pedophiles on its Board of Directors. All of these smaller websites have gotten hooked on a couple things. First is the egalitarian equality angle where everyone needs to be treated the same and have the same rate because the internet *must* be a public service (more on this later). The Second is that they have bought the zog chow that ISPs are going to start blocking websites wholesale just like they bought the zog chow that ISPs were going to start selling your porn browsing habits because the Senate passed a resolution which undid the FCC broadband privacy rulemaking and forbid the FCC from passing that rule in the future. The day before that passed ISPs could sell your browsing data, and the day after it passed ISPs could sell your browsing data, nothing changed. It was just the same companies like Facebook and Google who were raising the alarm because they wanted to be the only ones who could get your browsing data through your clickstream data, your browser fingerprint, cross device tracking, etc. At its most basic level it is an information war, an info war. (infowar.com, prisonplanet.com). So, back to blocking, none of these faggots would get their shit blocked unless they were distributing like child porn. It would occur with the same frequency it occurs now, which is 0. Its never happened. \n\nFor paid prioritization and throttling, the ISPs want to be able to provide the most competitive options and develop new and innovative options. For instance, my phone has zero rating for the directv app. This means that there is no data usage if I use the directv app, so what would be a data heavy app on my phone frees up data I can use elsewhere. Paid prioritization in effect would look like HBO paying extra for faster speeds during the Game of Thrones premier, or Steam getting faster speeds during the release of the 2017 Bernie Sanders Simulator. Throttling would impact those who select a lower tier of service. The post office has different tiers of service depending on when you want your shit delivered, this is the same thing. \n\nNow, to the public service argument.

It is all built upon a house of cards and potentially unconstitutional because of the potential and probable lack of authority. If you see the FCC do weird shit when regulating its because they are trying to expand their authority. They want to regulate more shit and so they are using bad statutory interpretation of old statutes not meant for these new situations. \n\nMy biggest problem with all of this is just the central planning.
