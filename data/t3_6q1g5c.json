I'm really struggling to see the connection between say, proving 1+1=2 and a belief in god. If the unknown question is \"what does 1+1 equal?\" a believe in the unknown that is \"god\" is not needed here. We can literally prove many axioms through math and I have just given an example of the most simple I could think of. Furthermore, you can be proving things to someone that people in general already hold to be true, like say someone who has never encountered math before. The \"unknown\" can already be known to someone and the proof can just be regurgitated. The process to figure out what proof is, is called using demonstrable logic. This is what the scientific method is. God is not needed anywhere in this equation (edgy I know). And lastly, you generally seem confused. Peterson isn't as you are in your example, simply equating the unknown to god, he is LITERALLY saying \"faith in god is a prerequisite to proof\". This is demonstrably false by the axiomatic truth 1+1=2. No faith in god is needed as a perquisite to prove this.

If the unknown question is &amp;quot;what does 1+1 equal?&amp;quot; a believe in the unknown that is &amp;quot;god&amp;quot; is not needed here. We can literally prove many axioms through math and I have just given an example of the most simple I could think of. Furthermore, you can be proving things to someone that people in general already hold to be true, like say someone who has never encountered math before. The &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; can already be known to someone and the proof can just be regurgitated. The process to figure out what proof is, is called using demonstrable logic. This is what the scientific method is. God is not needed anywhere in this equation (edgy I know). And lastly, you generally seem confused.

Right now, we essentially take those assumptions on faith. Whether or not you attribute those assumptions to god or random chance is irrelevant, they mean the same thing in that context since they are equally unknowable. As of now, the existence of a creator of the universe is no less likely to be true than the absence of a creator, so choosing to believe either is a choice.

We have no answer for &amp;quot;what caused the Big Bang&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;why are the laws of physics the exact way they are instead of a different way.&amp;quot; The explanation for the existence of everything in the universe is predicated on a set of assumptions that we are currently unable to prove, which Peterson refers to as axioms. Right now, we essentially take those assumptions on faith. Whether or not you attribute those assumptions to god or random chance is irrelevant, they mean the same thing in that context since they are equally unknowable. As of now, the existence of a creator of the universe is no less likely to be true than the absence of a creator, so choosing to believe either is a choice. This is not to say that the concept of a &amp;quot;personal&amp;quot; God isn&amp;#39;t ridiculous...it is.
