Since humans are naturally fallible, Communism can never work- indeed, the only system that can work in an imperfect world is Capitalism, which functions on the assumption that humans are naturally greedy and egotistical.\n\nThis argument, while popular, is nonetheless flawed due to (1) false assumptions about Communism, and (2) false assumptions about the nature of government, society, and economics.\n\nFirstly, Communism is by no means a Utopian system. There will always be issues with any system, and Communism recognizes this. Where in the works of Marx or Engels is Communism labeled a panacea for humanity\u2019s ailments? Where in Das Kapital or the Communist Manifesto is Marxism promised to solve all of man\u2019s problems? Nowhere. If anything, Marxism promises increased conflict, class warfare, and revolution! Hardly what one would call a \u201cUtopian\u201d system. It is because humans are naturally greedy and self-serving that Marx argues for Communism and against Capitalism. Humans are naturally violent and even murderous- that doesn\u2019t mean we create a legal system that makes allowances for humanity\u2019s shortcomings. As James Madison once put it, \u201cIf men were angels, no government would be necessary\u2026\u201d. How then can it be argued that Communism, a form of government, is based on the idea of humanity\u2019s perfection?\n\nSecondly, advocates of Capitalism will point to the fall of the Soviet Union and claim that this is prove that Communism doesn\u2019t work because of human nature. One, the Soviet Union was not Communist (and this cannot be emphasized enough) and two, if the person making this claim would only look at the state of the world, he would realize that nothing works in the long run. According to the laws of physics, everything goes from a state of order to a state of disorder over varying lengths of time. This applies not only to eroding rocks or decomposing meat but to society as well (this is often referred to as \u201cSocial entropy\u201d). Every society, regardless of it\u2019s political, economic, or legislative system will, at some point, become corrupted and self-destruct (or become weakened to the point where it is wiped out by another system or force). Is there anything inherently wrong or flawed about democracy? In general, no. Will democratic countries last forever? Absolutely not. Athens, the Roman Republic, pre-WWII Germany were all democracies and they all fell in ruin. Was it the fault of the system? Of course not- it was the fault of humans. As much as we try to halt the advance of disease in our bodies or corruption in our governments, we can only delay the inevitable process. The ancient Chinese were aware of this and rather than attempting to come up with a system of government that could circumnavigate social entropy, they based their political theory on the simple belief that what goes up, must come down. Their system was called the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d, which stated that when a dynasty became corrupt, the people had not the right but the obligation to revolt and instate a new government- a philosophy later echoed by America\u2019s founding father\u2019s in the Declaration of Independence (\u201cThat to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men\u2026 That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government\u2026\u201d). Yes, a Communist government would eventually become corrupt and collapse on itself, but so would a Capitalist government. The laws of physics aren\u2019t optional.\n\nIn short, since Communism is based on the belief that humans are naturally predisposed to greed, lawlessness, and violence, it is impossible and illogical to argue that Communism relies on the belief that humans are naturally good. Likewise, because a Communism government- like everything else- will at some point self-destruct (though hopefully, only to be replaced with a new Communist government), it is impossible and illogical to argue that Communism is an unattainable Utopia capable of solving the human curse of war, disease, crime, and conflict. And even if, purely for the sake of the argument, Communism is a Utopian cure-all for death, destruction, and decay, aren\u2019t there worse things to struggle for?\n\n- - -\n\nhumans are reward driven.  This has never been removed from individual motivations or those of groups of people.  The moment you offer people an opportunity to deliver mediocre work and still survive, you remove the pressures and temptations for hard work and ingenuity.  This then creates a downward spiral in which generations of people get less-motivated to deliver their best until the entire system collapses.  \"Why work hard, when I can be lazy and still have a place to live and food on the table.\"  By the end of the USSR, one of the world's greatest agri-regions was importing wheat from the USA, Canada and Argentina.  Pathetic. \n\n    Side Note:  I feel obligated to point out that we never saw anything that resembled truly what Marx &amp; Engels actually envisaged.  What we did get was a top-down authoritarian, tyrannical oligarchy that had nothing close to respect for individuals and their lives.  I'm not suggesting that true Marxism is any more workable, but since I don't have windows into alternate realities, I also cannot say with certainty that it could not.  I do believe -- taking all things into consideration -- that true Marxist economics (with a strong slant towards humanism / human rights) would ultimately fail, but that's nothing more than my opinion. \n\n\nThe very heart of capitalism is the reward for individual (and group) productivity, efficiency and inventiveness. This reward empowers and emboldens the inventor, worker, creator to continue working harder to earn more reward.  Communism removed this factor and granted life-sustaining \"things\" on a \"need\" basis and not an a meritocratic basis.  While Capitalism does/did this imperfectly and with notable exceptions, Communism never found a way to convince its masses of intelligent people to work hard, invent and create in a way that moved industry and the human experience forward.\n\nSome might cite Soviet accomplishments in military development, the Space Race and the Olympics, but then, we know that's not quite accurate.  In those select fields, superiority and achievement were rewarded and handsomely.  Sports heroes were provided notoriety and greater living conditions.  In the Space Race and military development, design bureaus were pitted against each other.  Rewards were granted to those who delivered superior products in the form of better living conditions and notoriety. \n\nSo, in the two areas that the Soviets did well in (or dominated) they achieved those ends NOT by appealing to the individuals' better, more patriotic instincts, but by waving dachas, notoriety, rewards and travel in front of them.\n\n- - -\n\n    Communism  begins with a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" followed by a reform in  society morale insomuch that a utopia is created, where the state  withers away and society lives in harmony.\n\n\nAnd therein lies its downfall.  Communism requires a fundamental change in human nature - AKA, \"The New Soviet man\" - and, to mix metaphors, \"homey don't play dat.\"  Human nature is what it is.  It hasn't changed in millennia, and isn't likely to.\n\nAnd, to quote James Lileks:\n\n\n    Personally, I\u2019m interested in keeping other people from building Utopia,  because the more you believe you can create heaven on earth the more  likely you are to set up guillotines in the public square to hasten the  process.\n\n\nEvery effort that has been made toward that Marxist Utopia has instead led to \"guillotines in the public square\" or worse.\n\n- - - \n\nIn a capitalist economy resources, production, labor, innovation, capital goods and consumer goods are all dynamically allocated according to constantly shifting supply and demand.\n\nThe only way any individual can determine the proper amount of widgets to buy for their doohickey factory, how many doohickeys they need to produce, at what cost and in what time is through prices.\n\nIt doesn't even come close to stopping there, as the owner of the doohickey factory you can deduce countless things about the entire doohickey market just by examining the various prices being charged.\nThis allows you to make all kinds of decisions for your company (doohickeys R us) and allows for very simple tracking of success (aka the bottom line).\n\nPrices are not arbitrary, they aren't just put into place to maximize profit, they are the spontaneous numerical synthesis of every economic factor that went into the product, resource, labor and or service.\n\n\nPrices are what allow a society of free acting individuals to co-ordinate all economic activity. When you consider how something so simple and spontaneous can voluntarily get millions of people to work together both directly and indirectly, it really is fascinating.\n\nCommunism however tries to force economic prosperity and equality without prices, or individual benefit.\nNot even an army of genetically modified super-bureaucrats could keep track of the constantly shifting informational/collective knowledge hurricane of an entire economy.\n\nThis is why in the Soviet Union you had (among many other things) a peculiar shortage of food yet a surplus of tractors and farming equipment.\nThe underlying assumption being that economic prosperity was directly and solely correlated with ones ability to produce.\n\nIt's a common mistake to view the economy as a simple piece of pie or machine that intakes materials and pumps out goods; when many people look at the function of economies, they fixate on just the snowy tuft on the tip of a huge iceberg.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communism is a fundamentally broken system due to human nature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially what is argued is that Marxism is a \u201cUtopian\u201d system which can only work if humans were perfect.

Their system was called the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d, which stated that when a dynasty became corrupt, the people had not the right but the obligation to revolt and instate a new government- a philosophy later echoed by America\u2019s founding father\u2019s in the Declaration of Independence (\u201cThat to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men\u2026 That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government\u2026\u201d). Yes, a Communist government would eventually become corrupt and collapse on itself, but so would a Capitalist government. The laws of physics aren\u2019t optional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, since Communism is based on the belief that humans are naturally predisposed to greed, lawlessness, and violence, it is impossible and illogical to argue that Communism relies on the belief that humans are naturally good. Likewise, because a Communism government- like everything else- will at some point self-destruct (though hopefully, only to be replaced with a new Communist government), it is impossible and illogical to argue that Communism is an unattainable Utopia capable of solving the human curse of war, disease, crime, and conflict. And even if, purely for the sake of the argument, Communism is a Utopian cure-all for death, destruction, and decay, aren\u2019t there worse things to struggle for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;humans are reward driven.  This has never been removed from individual motivations or those of groups of people.  The moment you offer people an opportunity to deliver mediocre work and still survive, you remove the pressures and temptations for hard work and ingenuity.  This then creates a downward spiral in which generations of people get less-motivated to deliver their best until the entire system collapses.  &amp;quot;Why work hard, when I can be lazy and still have a place to live and food on the table.&amp;quot;  By the end of the USSR, one of the world&amp;#39;s greatest agri-regions was importing wheat from the USA, Canada and Argentina.  Pathetic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Side Note:  I feel obligated to point out that we never saw anything that resembled truly what Marx &amp;amp; Engels actually envisaged.  What we did get was a top-down authoritarian, tyrannical oligarchy that had nothing close to respect for individuals and their lives.  I&amp;#39;m not suggesting that true Marxism is any more workable, but since I don&amp;#39;t have windows into alternate realities, I also cannot say with certainty that it could not.  I do believe -- taking all things into consideration -- that true Marxist economics (with a strong slant towards humanism / human rights) would ultimately fail, but that&amp;#39;s nothing more than my opinion. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The very heart of capitalism is the reward for individual (and group) productivity, efficiency and inventiveness. This reward empowers and emboldens the inventor, worker, creator to continue working harder to earn more reward.  Communism removed this factor and granted life-sustaining &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; on a &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; basis and not an a meritocratic basis.  While Capitalism does/did this imperfectly and with notable exceptions, Communism never found a way to convince its masses of intelligent people to work hard, invent and create in a way that moved industry and the human experience forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some might cite Soviet accomplishments in military development, the Space Race and the Olympics, but then, we know that&amp;#39;s not quite accurate.  In those select fields, superiority and achievement were rewarded and handsomely.  Sports heroes were provided notoriety and greater living conditions.  In the Space Race and military development, design bureaus were pitted against each other.  Rewards were granted to those who delivered superior products in the form of better living conditions and notoriety. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in the two areas that the Soviets did well in (or dominated) they achieved those ends NOT by appealing to the individuals&amp;#39; better, more patriotic instincts, but by waving dachas, notoriety, rewards and travel in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Communism  begins with a &amp;quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&amp;quot; followed by a reform in  society morale insomuch that a utopia is created, where the state  withers away and society lives in harmony.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And therein lies its downfall.  Communism requires a fundamental change in human nature - AKA, &amp;quot;The New Soviet man&amp;quot; - and, to mix metaphors, &amp;quot;homey don&amp;#39;t play dat.&amp;quot;  Human nature is what it is.  It hasn&amp;#39;t changed in millennia, and isn&amp;#39;t likely to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, to quote James Lileks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Personally, I\u2019m interested in keeping other people from building Utopia,  because the more you believe you can create heaven on earth the more  likely you are to set up guillotines in the public square to hasten the  process.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every effort that has been made toward that Marxist Utopia has instead led to &amp;quot;guillotines in the public square&amp;quot; or worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a capitalist economy resources, production, labor, innovation, capital goods and consumer goods are all dynamically allocated according to constantly shifting supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way any individual can determine the proper amount of widgets to buy for their doohickey factory, how many doohickeys they need to produce, at what cost and in what time is through prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t even come close to stopping there, as the owner of the doohickey factory you can deduce countless things about the entire doohickey market just by examining the various prices being charged.\nThis allows you to make all kinds of decisions for your company (doohickeys R us) and allows for very simple tracking of success (aka the bottom line).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prices are not arbitrary, they aren&amp;#39;t just put into place to maximize profit, they are the spontaneous numerical synthesis of every economic factor that went into the product, resource, labor and or service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prices are what allow a society of free acting individuals to co-ordinate all economic activity. When you consider how something so simple and spontaneous can voluntarily get millions of people to work together both directly and indirectly, it really is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Communism however tries to force economic prosperity and equality without prices, or individual benefit.\nNot even an army of genetically modified super-bureaucrats could keep track of the constantly shifting informational/collective knowledge hurricane of an entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why in the Soviet Union you had (among many other things) a peculiar shortage of food yet a surplus of tractors and farming equipment.\nThe underlying assumption being that economic prosperity was directly and solely correlated with ones ability to produce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a common mistake to view the economy as a simple piece of pie or machine that intakes materials and pumps out goods; when many people look at the function of economies, they fixate on just the snowy tuft on the tip of a huge iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/50klfk/how_old_is_sam/d74y1fz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_d74y1fz", "created": 1472728446.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1472699646.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_50klfk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d74tjn3", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Quate", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 9, "parent_id": "t3_50klfk", "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "He went to a very expensive college.
