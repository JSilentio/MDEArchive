It's just more clear to us now because with mass media the process accelerates exponentially. \n\nThe fact that people have been doing this forever doesn't really make it any less of a problem (not sure if that is your point but I wanted to say that if it is). People mindlessly basing their lives off of fiction is still a problem regardless of how long it's happened. \n\nAlso, I think the fact that the process has accelerated makes this even worse of a problem, rather than just making it more obvious that the problem exists. Say you have a person during the 1800's who reads a new Dickens novel and it influences how they live and they quote it occasionally when it's relevant to a situation. Then say you have a person in modern times who watches a shit ton of sitcoms and YouTube videos and they base all their mannerisms and everyday conversation off of these videos, only to change those mannerisms and conversation the next week because of some new sitcoms and YouTube videos. I would think the latter person is a much more shallow and generally shitty person than the former. I realize this is sort of a strawman and assumes a sort of nostalgic and idealistic version of history but I can't think of a better way to explain my point. I guess my point is that music, television, books etc. are all well and good but if you're overly saturated with them you're more likely to live a shallow fantasy life than someone who takes time to think about a piece of art rather than constantly moving on to the newest thing. And we are more likely to live this shallow fantasy life because we are far more saturated with \"art\" than before the internet. As you said, \"I would hazard a guess that more \"prank\" videos have been made in two years than books were written during all of the Romantic period.\" We don't have to wait years for the newest great Romantic novel, we expect and experience constant satisfaction.\n\n&gt;And it's already completely changed everything about how society interacts in public and private spaces. You walk around a college campus and make eye contact with no one.\n\nSo I guess this is gonna seem like a contradiction because I already ranted a little about how society has gotten worse but statements like the one above kinda annoy me and I think they're hyperbolic. The situation you describe will probably happen but it is not here yet. People still often have face-to-face conversation. People still make eye contact and wave to each other and say \"hi\". What you're describing sounds more to me like an overcrowded city like New York than your average college campus (and I live on campus at a large State University). And besides, in places where people really do walk past each other without saying anything and just generally being in a rush all the time, they have been like that for most of the 20th century, much longer than when cellphones have been around. I'm not even sure how much I'm disagreeing or agreeing with you here, your statement just kinda reminds me of people I know who say stuff like \"social media has actually made us less social\" and think they're being super profound so I felt like I needed to offer a counterpoint.\n\nSo I admit this is kind of a rushed post, I apologize if any of this is blatant bullshit. The internet is already saturated with enough of that and I don't want to contribute anymore.
