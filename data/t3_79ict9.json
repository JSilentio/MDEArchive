I believe in a single intitiated, spiritual leader or an order of inititated, wise men (think of Plato's philosopher-kings) fitting this description: Capable enough for their very being to rise above the masses and draw the masses up with them while going beyond mere human existence themselves.\n\n&gt;The problem is how to find those people. They're never found in a representative democracy, they are very rarely found in a dictatorship, they aren't common in a 'meritocracy' like a corporation either. People who seek power and do their utmost to get power aren't the ones who are best at handling power. Those who are good at getting into power are the best manipulators and con artists, not the best rulers. \n\nI believe these people do not need finding. Was the creator of any great empire \"found\"? No, he came and asserted his right as the best ruler. A transition to Tradition would not be something that happens overnight. It's not something that would happen democratically or with support of \"the people\". It would most likely have to be done with force. The first break from a civilization like ours into a Tradition would be very hard (and extremely unlikely, which is why I have next to no hope of seeing Tradition on this earth until our current civilization collapses), but after that men would be born and trained from birth to be capable enough to reach the next level. It could be compared to starting a divine fire and keeping it burning, the flames growing more powerful the longer it burns. Such is the way of Tradition. As to how common and uncommon they are, just take a look at the rulers of the early Roman Empire, the Greek Golden Ages, the beginning of the Gupta Empire and the Chinese and Japanese Empires at the height of their power.  All of these Empires have common traits, such as a focus on spiritualism and philosophy, strict hierarchies and power structures, loyalty and honor being more important than mere human life or comfort, common use of rituals and symbolic acts, a veneration and divine importance attached to your role in society (often whatever your craft may be), a spiritual attitude towards militarism and warfare in general,  supreme leadership being a divine role and the Emperor having a divine and symbolic function (in China he could even be put to death if certain events were seen as a result of him not living up to his station). The Emperor was bound to traditional laws as much as his subjects were. The most important traits in rulers next to capability were honesty and genuity, and the divine mandate of Tradition was passed on to each and every member of society, so they may strengthen each other and remove any threat to the Empire, their manifestation of the force drawing upward. \n\nNow, each of these Empires eventually stagnated and degenerated. Some lasted longer than others. This is the natural way of things. An organism is born and an organism dies. An Empire lives for as long as the flames of Tradition burn within it, and when they are extinguished it starts decaying, weakening and degenerating until it can stand no more and caves in on itself. This is the process we have been witnessing for thousands of years when it comes to western civilization (and the world in general, as western civilization has spread its anti-Traditional forces everywhere), with smaller cycles of growth and decay within these cycles. We are now approaching a trough in the bigger cycle, that of the world itself, and we shall suffer devastating consequences unless we can stave this off by trying to restore Tradition (something Julian The Apostate tried to do with the Roman Empire, for example). I know that such a salvation is unlikely, but on the off chance that it might happen I have abandoned Traditionalism's inherent apoliteia and taken to supporting right wing causes, because they are the only thing right now that may delay the rapid flow of degeneration and, if viewed with a grand dose of optimism, may even serve as a stage for Tradition to take place on. If Tradition will be restored, it will most probably be through violence, but a violence made to bring order. If it shall not be restored, many will suffer in the infinitely greater violence of chaos, which will continue untill Tradition brings order. \n\n&gt;The second problem is the disgruntled underlings. Let's assume you're right and that they would be happy with their place in your utopia. How about on the way there? The dumb, weak and sick are used to being coddled. They won't accept their place at the bottom of society in the transitional period. \n\nTradition does not simply trample on the dumb, weak and sick. Sadism and cruelty is not befitting of Tradition. It gives them a purpose and an opportunity to live their life despite their limitations. A person in the modern age is conditioned to always want more, despite their capabilities. A person in the modern age is conditioned to regard itself as equal with everyone, and virtually limitless in its potential. In Tradition a person is supposed to dedicate its life to going beyond what it is in a manner that is suitable for it. There is a function even for the dumbest, weakest and the sickest, unless they are so dumb, weak and sick that their entire existence is made up of suffering, in which case their life can not bear fruit for anyone including them and is thereby forfeit.  \n\nThe revolts you talk about should be responded to in kind. It's an initiative of quantity versus quality, and quality should respond with a violence as unbridled as that of the quantity. Civil wars are bound to happen, but that's only natural. It is how Rome was purified and turned from a Republic to an Empire. Life is a struggle. \n\n&gt;Even if you could find the people who are objectively most fit to rule, they too are flawed in some ways. What if those farther down the hierarchy notice their flaws and don't want to be a part of it anymore?\n\nA person dedicated to Tradition would not attempt to breach the hierarchy that it rests on, but in case of a leader desecrating the position he was granted from above, the intervention of other initiates is very well in order. A leader has the plight to lead his people to something more than what they are. If he himself becomes too human, or worse, less than human he needs to be replaced, simple as that. This is one of the reasons why the idea of an order instead of a single leader is attractive.\n\n", "edited": 1509332500.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There we have it then, you believe in a completely enlightened and benevolent dictator/ruling class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a somewhat simple way to describe it, but yes.

There is a function even for the dumbest, weakest and the sickest, unless they are so dumb, weak and sick that their entire existence is made up of suffering, in which case their life can not bear fruit for anyone including them and is thereby forfeit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The revolts you talk about should be responded to in kind. It&amp;#39;s an initiative of quantity versus quality, and quality should respond with a violence as unbridled as that of the quantity. Civil wars are bound to happen, but that&amp;#39;s only natural. It is how Rome was purified and turned from a Republic to an Empire. Life is a struggle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you could find the people who are objectively most fit to rule, they too are flawed in some ways. What if those farther down the hierarchy notice their flaws and don&amp;#39;t want to be a part of it anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A person dedicated to Tradition would not attempt to breach the hierarchy that it rests on, but in case of a leader desecrating the position he was granted from above, the intervention of other initiates is very well in order. A leader has the plight to lead his people to something more than what they are. If he himself becomes too human, or worse, less than human he needs to be replaced, simple as that. This is one of the reasons why the idea of an order instead of a single leader is attractive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/79ict9/the_chad_political_spectrum_vs_the_virgin_centrist/dp2tgna/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dp2tgna", "created": 1509361003.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1509332203.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dp2qyb1", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MakeAmericaSageAgain", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 5, "parent_id": "t1_dp2p2vx", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I appreciate your answer and although there are things I disagree with I'll focus on our common ground.\n\n&gt; Yes.

Which it was. \n\n&gt;What is a \"developed\" political orientation? One that happens to correspond with yours?\n\nNot at all. There's a reason why people can unite under certain ideologies, and it's not because it's an easy thing to do. It's because, when one develops a view of the world and his own stance on politics, he will at some point arrive at a certain political direction he can describe his viewpoints in. This does not mean that he blindly assumes every standpoint of that direction. \n\n&gt;I don't think hierarchy or power structures are necessarily bad. They are good if they're voluntary and beneficiary for both parties. \n\n&gt;I'm a fan of small scale direct democracy. Let's have a meeting in town hall every month to decide what the fuck we should do with our lives. \n\n&gt;Why do you have a problem with people independently deciding what is best for themselves by themselves? \n\nA combined answer to these questions and statements:\nBecause people in general are incompetent, and that's not simply a matter of the current state of the human race. Natural selection is a thing, and a vast majority of human beings born will not be fit to make such decisions. It's simply how nature works. Democracy, even the small scale kind, is inherently a symptom of the decay of a civilization because it operates on the nation that power is given to a ruler by the people instead of being his natural right for being the best person to rule at that given time. I'm sure you're thinking: \"Right, if my town was full of good natured, reasonable people it'd all be fine.\" The question is how you think such people are cultivated. My answer is, of course, Tradition, which needs to be enforced by an upward drawing power. There is no upward drawing power if there is nothing to look up to, which is why democracy is incompatible with it. A society is an organism. To perform healthily the people that serve as its cells must be devoted to it, fulfill their function and strive to become more than human through personal development while fulfilling that function and strengthening themselves and society, thus being lifted up by the higher power I was talking about. Life must become more than a mere animalistc, empirical experience. To make these things the center of one's existence is something that can only be reached through Tradition. \n\n&gt;Is it because you fear you wouldn't be able to do that for yourself?\n\nI'm already doing it, so there's nothing to fear, although I feel that you will mock this answer.\n\n&gt;The whole, as you choose to call it, is an imaginary created inside your own head. \n\nWhat you describe as a whole is not just created based on purely your own experience. It is a matter of culture, the development thereof and their influence on the collective unconsciousness. These things are why your (and many other people's) image of a conservative is, among other things, someone who hates marijuana and hates gays. The same goes for the liberal equivalent. So far I've noticed that you think in very American terms, both in terms of freedom and in terms of politics in general. This also stands for the influence of culture on the way your mind constructs a reality out of the information it receives. In a modern world, obsessed with liberty and equality above everything, this culture is an amalgamation of restless, directionless forces of a thousand opposing voices. Imagine a mind shaped by Tradition. It doesn't matter if you find the concept unrealistic, but just imagine a mind shaped by a culture focused on an objective, perennial truth, a feeling of function, beloning and a drive to become more than human. Imagine how one man would view another through the prism of such a mind, imagine how one man would view concepts such as power, duty and freedom through such a mind. It doesn't do a difference that big justice to be put into words. \n\n&gt;There is not a lot of debate going on right now. These debates are more often than not ideological purity tests to establish a homogeneous stance on a new issue or to root out all the heretics/nazis/cucks/bugmen. \n\nOf course. We're living in times of great crisis with powers clashing not from without, but from within. The force that stands divided will be weakened, so nobody can afford that. All sides of this conflict are fighting for their very survival, and the one which will stand most divided, most separated and most weakened will suffer and perish (with a chance of return, I give you that). We live in a society of quantity over quality (another symptom of the decay of a civilization, closely tied to democracy), and you should not expect politics and the discussion thereof to work any differently. Once a victor emerges, however, the development of their ideology will go on (as nothing in this temporal world exists without change), which means the debate you're so starved for is inevitable. This does not mean that the real world adheres to the label you've decided to attach to it. Observe forums of both right and left, beyond reddit, and you'll find that these two very broad labels hold lots of different opinions and thoughts within them, and that these are debated quite often. As examples of these I can give you the various political boards of 8chan. Not only /pol/ and /leftypol/, take a look at things like /liberty/, /anarchy/ and the like as well.\n\n&gt;I consider myself knowledgeable enough to make political decisions that concern myself.\n\nWell spoken. You already know what I think about the ideas expressed in the line after that, so I won't dwell further on this. \n\n&gt;I hold freedom as the highest value.\n\nMan demands freedom. He wants the be free. The question is not: \"Free because of what?\", which has been somewhat of a slogan in mdoern culture, which decided to answer it with \"Because he is a man like any other.\" A question truly worth asking is \"Free FOR what?\". Not every child should be permitted the same amount of freedom. One child can handle it, one child can not. If one gives the same amount of freedom to a child without discipline as he does to a child with discipline (in this case quite a large amount), he will witness only destruction, both within and without. If he gives the same amount of freedom to a child with discipline as he does to a child without discipline (in this case very little) he will see the equivalent of a child restrained in a small box and growing misshapen as a result, only psychically. Both of these children will end up sick, misshapen, diseased. I hope you can see my point. \n\n&gt;It's impossible to answer that question without a more clear definition of what \"modern day degeneracy\" is. Is it everything you dislike?\n\nNot at all. Modern day degeneracy is the loss of Tradition and the resulting sickness and societal malformation I have described. Examples of this are to be seen everywhere, from the obvious (such as the way modern western culture treats children) to the less obvious (the \"quantity over quality\" principle I described). Ingredients for a dysfunctional society. \n\n&gt;Why do you think your morals are so much more objectively superior to the morals of others that you have the right to enforce them upon people?\n\nMy morals are something personal. I believe in a power drawing upwards, reached by fulfilling one's existence to the best of one's abilities and, working in synergy within Tradition, growing beyond it. The very point of trying to reach that power is that it is superior to our humanity and is superior to any and all human morals.\n\n&gt;Freedom of the individual does not equate to division.\n\nNot when one can handle that freedom without damaging the framework of Tradition. \n\n&gt;People will flock to the society that is best for them and corresponds with their own philosophy\n\nThis is false. The vast majority of people will flock to the society that can fulfill their basic animal needs to best, or fabricates new needs for them to fulfill. Only a handful of people would make the choice of a society a purely philosophical one. \n\n&gt;Yes. If I found a leader that knew the objective truth and ruled justly according to it I would follow him. If I lost faith in his leadership I want the opportunity to leave.\n\nGood. There is nothing in this statement I do not agree with. \n\n&gt;I hope your satisfied with these answers. \n\nYou put more thought into this than I thought, so I'm happy. \n\n&gt;I don't think we're really that different. Just our way of expressing it.\n\nWe might share some fairly important principles, so there could be some truth to that.\n\n \n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;You don&amp;#39;t agree with me?
