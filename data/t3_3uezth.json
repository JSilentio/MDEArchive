The problem with modern day US is the lack of ethnic homogeneity which precludes attempts to form a social system with solidarity and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sittlichkeit\"&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s also why importing the third world hordes is going to destroy the European social states. No one wants to pay taxes to care for a lazy foreign parasite. The social is tied to the national. \nOnly one part of society gains from the destruction of the social, that is the upper class, in the U.S. represented by a certain minorty. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/3uezth/sam_perception_shift/cxhtq9o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_cxhtq9o", "created": 1448914071.0, "author_flair_text": "i know about funny stuff you couldnt even imagine", "created_utc": 1448885271.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cxes18x", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blarfmar", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_cxej9wr", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Well reasoned paragraphs here, though not exactly responding to the thrust of mine.

I think trying to delineate into two neat categories of \"punching up\" and \"punching down\" is fallacious because it's not that simple. Of course pretentious capitalist shitheads are everyone's enemies but once you get past strictly economic delineations it's not that clear cut because people have different interests. Of course in some ways the system is more shitty for black people and certain minorities to some extent, I'm not denying that, and that fucking sucks and I could get behind solving it in a general sense, however realistic. The real point is this doesn't mean it's somehow in every white person's interests to have their identities deconstructed and made to hate themselves. \n\nI'm honestly of the opinion that if any system coerces against how a group organically feels, it can be construed as a form of brainwashing and perhaps \"oppression\". No black person \"organically\" wants to be arrested for being black, right? Because of how they're wired? No one wants to be killed unless they're super depressed and suicidal, and therefore the law is made that murder is illegal. Therefore that underpinning axiom must be applied to all situations consistently and that is my worldview, simple as that. This is the big issue that a lot of \"leftists\" do not understand and this philosophical stance is the only ideologically consistent way to fight them. Regardless of whether or not whites have \"privilege\" it is still morally wrong to deconstruct their identities for whatever reason, and people have a right to oppose that. They have the right to not have colleges teach kids to hate themselves. \n\nEuropeans also have the right to keep Europe majority ethnic European. If you talk to the majority of people in Europe except for maybe Germany and especially Sweden where it's especially fucking bad, there is no significant amount of people who will be okay with becoming minorities in their own countries. This hints that this opinion is close to the \"default\" and therefore can never be morally right. Any \"system\" that doesn't cater to the real opinions of the people is unjust and must be dismantled. Forcefully. It cannot be ethically defended under any circumstance regardless of how the argument is framed. The way \"leftists\" tend to deconstruct these things always seemed wonky to me, you know like Gramscian critical theory stuff? They have this tendency to ether rationalize all of these things as products of bourgeois brainwashing or flat out make generalizations that don't mean much of anything. There has never been any evidence to suggest the generalities of ethnic solidarity were *solely* top-down, how do you know the alleged \"examples\" aren't the ruling classes responding to the people's general opinions? If they're not claiming it's the product of the upper classes' brainwashing, they're acting like how people feel regarding empirical facts is somehow wrong whilst claiming to speak for the common person. It's complete trite crap and a lot of assumptions. \n\nThis mentality is more of a \"Marxist\" one, in a general sense, and I feel aspects of it are borderline *autistic*. Not, mind you, autistic as in \"generalized internet insult\" autistic but *literally* autistic. An aspect of autism is not understanding how people think and not being able to relate to them. Marxists have a primarily economic worldview that, whilst implying itself to be populist, rationalizes all things that do not suit this economic, class-based narrative as products of the ruling class, generally without flat-out empirical evidence of this being factual. This is why Liberals, primarily Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris types, in my opinion, are smarter since they generally just advocate people be \"rational\" Vulcans from Star Trek, but even then Liberals have this tendency to lump things that aren't inherently about denying empirical evidence in the same category as believing in creationism or believing the earth is flat; their definition of \"irrational\" is broad and the things under that category aren't always ontologically the same as each other. Somehow I understood this ever since I was a kid but I was never able to explain it until recently, and I think the reason I understood it is because I lack an ego and as a result I don't think in \"thought categories\" and narratives, so I'm practically immune to cognitive fallacies.\n\nI think \"far-right\" neo-nazi/pol-tier political extremism is an extreme knee-jerk to these organic feelings being suppressed. The whole \"I'm not ashamed of anything Europeans have done\" and joking about \"those damn niggers\" and Trayvon Martin getting shot is a reaction because of the way the system is framed - the people telling us about that are also *generally* on the same \"side\" of the people who to attack our ethnic groups and destroy them, whether the intended goal or not. It is understandable but I think it's best we look past this and be consistent. Of course imperialism was generally horrible, slavery was wrong and it's sad what happened to the majority of the Native Americans even if it wasn't this clear-cut one-sided Nazi holocaust-tier genocide through sheer intent. Acknowledging these things were of course wrong should not be mutually exclusive with allowing Europeans to preserve ethnic majorities and have a fair amount of ethnic identity.
