A critical message and no solution balances impact, legitimacy, and entertainment power\n\nB. The basic message is very simple critique of a major trend, nothing \"/pol/\" about it\n\nC. Sam's done a pretty good job of quality-controlling the external political-philosophical content he channels (and hopefully he has a sustainable way of keeping that up)\n\nWhat's good about commentaries like this is that they don't identify a solution. Shrewd comedians/commentators know that there's too much involved to make a solution, unlike the vast majority of naive, low-quality entertainers in Hollywood and on bad talk shows. The point of these screeds, and to an extent MDE in general, is to bring attention (and to encourage the assessment/repair of) the attitudes and behaviors of a large swath of people. This, in turn, can change the public discourse, teach people that they\u2019re free to opt in or out of macro trends, lead by example, you name it. It's stupid to think that any one person can make a solution, but it's smart to give possible decision makers a sweet little perceptual toolkit.\n\nThe whole \u201canti-democrat\u201d thing is legitimate insofar as the lower 98th percentile of voters are retarded (and the rest are na\u00efve idealists), but the Dem-Dems have branded themselves as intellectually superior and morally righteous. Which might have been an okay combo if the world could be broken down that way, but it\u2019s too complicated for that. Still, the Dem-Dems have had the big bad scary complicated world put in a blender and made into an easy-to-swallow notion of simple dichotomy with an obvious right and wrong answer to choose from. To a point where jon stewert makes a living (a killing) joking about how \u201cobvious\u201d it is. There\u2019s a lot more to how messed up this all is, but conveying the notion that people aren\u2019t thinking clearly and are at once na\u00efve, arrogant, brainwashed into a self-perception of openmindedness yet ignorant is a pretty good rhetorical start for Sam to take.\n\nBe careful not to conflate the examples/imagery with the very basic thematic elements. Rhetorically you Gotta Go Extreme, gotta jolt people, that\u2019s what Sam\u2019s doing. The basic message, as always, is about \u201cself-respect and sustainability,\u201d which you can extrapolate pretty well into how modern \u201cProgressive\u201d notions destroy discourse and contribute to overwhelming widespread complacency in underdeveloped perspectives. I\u2019ve been doing my homework these past few weeks getting caught up on Stephan Molyneux and I totally see the points of intersection with central MDE themes, particularly Molyneux\u2019s parenting and sociology related stuff that explains how people can turn into (or more aptly, remain) complete babies forever. Less so, the countering of the horribly na\u00efve feminist movement and the alternate perspectives on the mechanics of major events and social issues. But there\u2019s some limitation, substantial quackery, and a lot of agenda, particularly in politics and philosophy, but also peppered throughout the more cogent of Molyneux\u2019s productions. Probably a good enough guy, definitely on point at times, but definitely not to be taken for face value or for all that he says. So far, I\u2019ve only seen Sam directly and explicitly identify with the higher-quality Molyneux opinions. Half of me can rest assured that Sam knows this or is smart enough to make these judgments consistently and prudently, while the other half prays he doesn\u2019t fuck it up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t /pol/ and this isn\u2019t Free Domain Radio and this isn\u2019t a white supremacist club. It\u2019s a damn fine admixture of perspectives (the best?) in a time when virtually everyone doesn\u2019t care, harbors garbage reductive views, conflates immiscible beliefs until they have no value at all, etc etc etc. I have yet to be disappointed by MDE and I don\u2019t see it happening.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Sam&amp;#39;s right b/c:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A.

The point of these screeds, and to an extent MDE in general, is to bring attention (and to encourage the assessment/repair of) the attitudes and behaviors of a large swath of people. This, in turn, can change the public discourse, teach people that they\u2019re free to opt in or out of macro trends, lead by example, you name it. It&amp;#39;s stupid to think that any one person can make a solution, but it&amp;#39;s smart to give possible decision makers a sweet little perceptual toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole \u201canti-democrat\u201d thing is legitimate insofar as the lower 98th percentile of voters are retarded (and the rest are na\u00efve idealists), but the Dem-Dems have branded themselves as intellectually superior and morally righteous. Which might have been an okay combo if the world could be broken down that way, but it\u2019s too complicated for that. Still, the Dem-Dems have had the big bad scary complicated world put in a blender and made into an easy-to-swallow notion of simple dichotomy with an obvious right and wrong answer to choose from. To a point where jon stewert makes a living (a killing) joking about how \u201cobvious\u201d it is. There\u2019s a lot more to how messed up this all is, but conveying the notion that people aren\u2019t thinking clearly and are at once na\u00efve, arrogant, brainwashed into a self-perception of openmindedness yet ignorant is a pretty good rhetorical start for Sam to take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to conflate the examples/imagery with the very basic thematic elements. Rhetorically you Gotta Go Extreme, gotta jolt people, that\u2019s what Sam\u2019s doing. The basic message, as always, is about \u201cself-respect and sustainability,\u201d which you can extrapolate pretty well into how modern \u201cProgressive\u201d notions destroy discourse and contribute to overwhelming widespread complacency in underdeveloped perspectives. I\u2019ve been doing my homework these past few weeks getting caught up on Stephan Molyneux and I totally see the points of intersection with central MDE themes, particularly Molyneux\u2019s parenting and sociology related stuff that explains how people can turn into (or more aptly, remain) complete babies forever. Less so, the countering of the horribly na\u00efve feminist movement and the alternate perspectives on the mechanics of major events and social issues. But there\u2019s some limitation, substantial quackery, and a lot of agenda, particularly in politics and philosophy, but also peppered throughout the more cogent of Molyneux\u2019s productions. Probably a good enough guy, definitely on point at times, but definitely not to be taken for face value or for all that he says. So far, I\u2019ve only seen Sam directly and explicitly identify with the higher-quality Molyneux opinions. Half of me can rest assured that Sam knows this or is smart enough to make these judgments consistently and prudently, while the other half prays he doesn\u2019t fuck it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn\u2019t /pol/ and this isn\u2019t Free Domain Radio and this isn\u2019t a white supremacist club. It\u2019s a damn fine admixture of perspectives (the best?) in a time when virtually everyone doesn\u2019t care, harbors garbage reductive views, conflates immiscible beliefs until they have no value at all, etc etc etc. I have yet to be disappointed by MDE and I don\u2019t see it happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme",
