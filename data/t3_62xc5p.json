You will at most have to deal with SJW events once a month, be it the rape awareness t-shirt week or my personal favorite, &amp;quot;anti-shame week&amp;quot; which brought tampon drives and menstruation education seminars lmfao. If you have a sense of humor about how bad colleges are abt sjw shit then you should be fine, plus going into college and not having your opinion coddled is vital for learning how to maneuver your views in blue waters we&amp;#39;ll all have to deal with from now on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a load of people, like my friends and many others, though, who are more than exasperated with SJW-climate and are willing to criticize it. It&amp;#39;s good to understand where they are coming from - by and large most ppl who mouth approval of SJW stuff just want gay and black people treated normally - and it&amp;#39;s easy to tell who is a hardcore intersectionalist communist versus not. You&amp;#39;ll never get egged or anything for being a white person, nor will you have disgusto&amp;#39;s blocking your path all the time -- but sometimes the disgusto&amp;#39;s do come out and protest in numbers of a few dozen, or march down broad street w similar strength.
