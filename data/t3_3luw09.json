I don't really feel like I have a \"white\" identity but I do agree with the shit about masculinity and this stupid migrant crisis where people use the children as a way to overlook the rapists, leeches and terrorists that are quite clearly coming through the borders (because there have been cases of these things already). To the emotional leftists, these rapists, Sharia-followers, opportunists and terrorists are a fair price to pay to \"save\" a few thousand children they've never met, even though they never really cared about kids in general that much before. \n\nThe masculinity thing though is really important. I see women trying harder and harder to imitate classical male behavior and all they do is get a bizarre, fucked up version of it that isn't real (I'm one of the guys! I am very focused on my career! I hate intimacy!) so all they do is actually slowly mold masculinity into something else. It's like Bruce Jenner's BS. If I was a woman, I'd be really insulted by Bruce Jenner walking around in a wig and high heels and saying he's a \"woman\".\n\nYou want to see how tolerant women really are about the Bruce Jenners of the world? Go out to a bar and strike up a convo with a qt liberal leftist feminist. In the most innocent of tones ask her if she is transgender and watch her facial reaction. It will turn from shock to confusion to suppressed anger. Women rightfully hate being mistaken for a man in a dress. Wonder why?!?!\n\nAnd yeah, men are fucked.

I don&amp;#39;t really feel like I have a &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; identity but I do agree with the shit about masculinity and this stupid migrant crisis where people use the children as a way to overlook the rapists, leeches and terrorists that are quite clearly coming through the borders (because there have been cases of these things already). To the emotional leftists, these rapists, Sharia-followers, opportunists and terrorists are a fair price to pay to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; a few thousand children they&amp;#39;ve never met, even though they never really cared about kids in general that much before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The masculinity thing though is really important. I see women trying harder and harder to imitate classical male behavior and all they do is get a bizarre, fucked up version of it that isn&amp;#39;t real (I&amp;#39;m one of the guys! I am very focused on my career! I hate intimacy!) so all they do is actually slowly mold masculinity into something else. It&amp;#39;s like Bruce Jenner&amp;#39;s BS. If I was a woman, I&amp;#39;d be really insulted by Bruce Jenner walking around in a wig and high heels and saying he&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;woman&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to see how tolerant women really are about the Bruce Jenners of the world? Go out to a bar and strike up a convo with a qt liberal leftist feminist. In the most innocent of tones ask her if she is transgender and watch her facial reaction. It will turn from shock to confusion to suppressed anger. Women rightfully hate being mistaken for a man in a dress. Wonder why?!?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yeah, men are fucked.

Basically, I'm going to pick apart what I find disagreeable in it and I'd like to see you clarify some of your points afterwards. If you're just sick of all this (and I don't blame you if you are) then don't worry about responding but please don't respond with some snarky one-liner about arabs being white. I either want to see nothing in response to this or something that actually helps me understand your views better. So here it goes I guess.\n\n&gt;African slavery and Chinese railroad workers didn't invent the combustion engine or the radio or the assembly line\n\nIsn't the fact that they were oppressed by white people relevant here? I don't mean this as a criticism of white people or to suggest we should have white guilt, but just logically speaking, if one group of people controls a second group of people and keeps them so busy with work they can't have a proper education or spare time to create things, isn't it obvious they aren't going to invent anything? The key part here is that they wouldn't be inventing anything not due to their own fault but due to the fault of someone forcing them not to invent anything. So I don't really get what your point here is or how it's relevant to modern non-white immigrants.\n\n&gt;I'm just tired of watching White people take it in the ass because they're afraid of appearing rude.\n\nYeah it's definitely sickening and pure garbage for someone to feel bad about themselves because of their ancestry. I don't really disagree with this statement at all but it does make me wonder what this has to do with all the other stuff you're talking about. Like yeah the mainstream media definitely has a liberal bent and that's shitty, but there's still plenty of white people in America who have positions of power and feel no guilt whatsoever over being white. I guess what I'm asking is, is the trend towards SJW liberalism really so big that it makes any sense to rant about how our country is going to be overrun by Sharia law and Muslim rapists? I'm not saying you shouldn't be posting about politics at all (and I'm sick of people saying \"stick to the comedy lol\") or even that you should stop using passionate/offensive language, but it needs to still be accurate and stuff along the lines of frizzy-haired Afro transsexuals are guilting white people into allowing systematic rape and murder makes me skeptical of how accurate you are.

I say that because violence_exe was giving those as examples of positive influences of immigration and since you dismissed them it almost seems like you're dismissing the idea that any non-white immigrants could ever contribute anything positive to white society, which seems dumb to me (and I know I'm stretching a lot from a single sentence but in the context I feel like my interpretation makes sense so sorry if I completely blew this particular statement out of proportion).

Basically, I&amp;#39;m going to pick apart what I find disagreeable in it and I&amp;#39;d like to see you clarify some of your points afterwards. If you&amp;#39;re just sick of all this (and I don&amp;#39;t blame you if you are) then don&amp;#39;t worry about responding but please don&amp;#39;t respond with some snarky one-liner about arabs being white. I either want to see nothing in response to this or something that actually helps me understand your views better. So here it goes I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;African slavery and Chinese railroad workers didn&amp;#39;t invent the combustion engine or the radio or the assembly line&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t the fact that they were oppressed by white people relevant here? I don&amp;#39;t mean this as a criticism of white people or to suggest we should have white guilt, but just logically speaking, if one group of people controls a second group of people and keeps them so busy with work they can&amp;#39;t have a proper education or spare time to create things, isn&amp;#39;t it obvious they aren&amp;#39;t going to invent anything? The key part here is that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be inventing anything not due to their own fault but due to the fault of someone forcing them not to invent anything. So I don&amp;#39;t really get what your point here is or how it&amp;#39;s relevant to modern non-white immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just tired of watching White people take it in the ass because they&amp;#39;re afraid of appearing rude.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah it&amp;#39;s definitely sickening and pure garbage for someone to feel bad about themselves because of their ancestry. I don&amp;#39;t really disagree with this statement at all but it does make me wonder what this has to do with all the other stuff you&amp;#39;re talking about. Like yeah the mainstream media definitely has a liberal bent and that&amp;#39;s shitty, but there&amp;#39;s still plenty of white people in America who have positions of power and feel no guilt whatsoever over being white. I guess what I&amp;#39;m asking is, is the trend towards SJW liberalism really so big that it makes any sense to rant about how our country is going to be overrun by Sharia law and Muslim rapists? I&amp;#39;m not saying you shouldn&amp;#39;t be posting about politics at all (and I&amp;#39;m sick of people saying &amp;quot;stick to the comedy lol&amp;quot;) or even that you should stop using passionate/offensive language, but it needs to still be accurate and stuff along the lines of frizzy-haired Afro transsexuals are guilting white people into allowing systematic rape and murder makes me skeptical of how accurate you are.

I don't think (and a lot of others on the right agree) that multiculturalism actually preserves culture as such. It leads to the appearance of a society possessing multiple cultures by way of kebab stands and yoga centers, but the core parts of the culture (values, life-devoted art and music, some sort of collective view on spirituality) are no longer there; they get replaced by materialist consumerism and domination of the most stubborn culture (see Islam in the UK as an example; a lot of them don't even *like* the multiculturalism present in UK society, they just like that the society is more functional than the one they came from).\n\n&gt;Is that indicative of a wider problem in the US with a cultural elite that doesn't know what they're talking about? Yes. Do prominent Leftists talk about helping others without caring about anyone but themselves? Yes, absolutely. But hypocrisy on the Left does not mean that the exact opposite of what the Left believes is correct. George Orwell could criticize the Left of his day (read: apologists for Stalin in 30's and 40's Britain) while still retaining the humanistic basis of a lot of Leftist beliefs. I wish Sam Hyde were doing that, but he's not.\n\nWatch a Zizek youtube talk or something, you can get criticisms of the same sort of stuff from his Left perspective if you'd like (though he gets called fascist a lot). For what it's worth, a lot of people who are identified as nationalists don't actually have a problem with national left politics, myself included. I don't think Sam would either, but I could be wrong.\n\n&gt;In Britain, people have been sexually abused by groups who received tax money that were white too. At least in America, the vast amount of sexual abuse happens within families. It's great that Rotherham was discovered and the perpetrators could be stopped. But there are also issues related to child abuse that aren't going to be solved by projecting our fears onto others.\n\n&gt;You don't think that the salaries of the MPs and PMs that abused children or helped in the coverup were paid for by the British people? Does that make me think that British people are by nature sexual abusers? No. Or that Margaret Thatcher, who was charged with running the country, wasn't a hypocrite for representing the British people and failing to protect its most vulnerable members?

To me, that suggests a cultural problem within the US rather than an underlying problem of &amp;quot;race,&amp;quot; because you would expect all people of a &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; to behave according to their inherent moral character rather than according to the environment in which they were raised (i.e. nature vs. nurture).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dude, no one is saying that we&amp;#39;d be living in a utopia if it weren&amp;#39;t for immigrants - people just don&amp;#39;t want to be importing populations with higher rates of violence than the natives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suppose I&amp;#39;m an American moving to England -- how absurd would it be for people in England say, &amp;quot;Well look at the incidences of sexual assault among the white American population. Obviously, white Americans value sexual assault in their culture.&amp;quot; Or say that an English person was moving to America, and I were to say, well the BBC covered up sex crimes, therefore this British person must be a sexual deviant. Cultures don&amp;#39;t get together at a meeting and say, &amp;quot;Well let&amp;#39;s commit such-and-such crimes.&amp;quot; Confusing what some segment of the population does with the ability of human beings to develop a moral code is absurd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sam Hyde specifically picked out Rotherham as evidence that immigrants are likely to increase the rate of sex crimes in England -- which is about as sensible as saying that the native English population increases the rate of sex crimes in England because there have been sex rings within native groups. Most English natives would be disgusted by Jimmy Savile and most Pakistani people would be disgusted by Rotherham. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are immigrants from countries where there is organized crime -- but it&amp;#39;s not as though saying that if you emigrate from Japan you&amp;#39;re likely to be a member of the Yakuza or if you emigrate from Italy you&amp;#39;re likely to be a member of the Mafia, any more than if you&amp;#39;re from Pakistan you&amp;#39;re sympathetic to al-Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the arguments Sam Hyde makes are not exactly new, and 100 years ago they probably would have put him outside of the norm if he wasn&amp;#39;t 100% descended from English ancestors, preferably if they came over on the Mayflower. German-Americans were seen as sympathetic to their home country during WW1 and WW2, and because a small segment of the Italian population was sympathetic to Anarchist causes, Italian immigrants were lynched. This isn&amp;#39;t even getting into how Irish or Jewish immigrants were treated. Many Jewish refugees were turned away from the US when Hitler was in power, and ended up in concentration camps. I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of US citizens didn&amp;#39;t want the &amp;quot;burden&amp;quot; of immigrants &amp;quot;diluting&amp;quot; American culture then, either.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/3luw09/is_mde_becoming_more_right_leaning_from_a/cvvcq5k/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_cvvcq5k", "created": 1444554954.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1444526154.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cvvai43", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "0780984332578", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 7, "parent_id": "t1_cvv77qk", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Right away the AAA statement starts with a non-sequitur\n\n&gt;Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. \n\nSo fucking what?

And I'm a super tolerant guy, I'm perfectly happy to have people screaming in my face and insulting me if that's what it takes to have prosperity and a stable and fair society. But if you read enough of this shit you realize that's not the endgame plan--the plan is to have anything white/masculine/traditional totally eliminated or suppressed. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA year or two back, I might've said the most important issues were... surveillance, ending the war on drugs, campaign finance reform, military adventurism--something like that. But I've grown weary of having all this feminist nihilist shit plopped on my lap, and I'm tired of people telling me that I've got some original sin and the only way to cleanse myself is by acting like Tim Wise. Gamergate was eye-opening, #BlackLivesMatter was eye-opening, but what really drove the point home and crystalized this perspective was reading about things like Rotherham...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEurope is in a dire situation: culture is being destroyed, some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps, and a lot of these places might not ever be the same. I don't think that's a good thing, or a healthy thing, to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are 10-20x more likely to rape. I'm sorry I just don't think that's good, I know it's insensitive as hell, but it's too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently. This is just the way it is, Europe is being invaded and we'd better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate. Send them money, let them use the technology we invented, give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty, quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good, but by keeping borders open we're taking the most productive, inventive, civilized, free countries and dumping them into the incinerator. Of course we have problems, of course the NSA is bad, of course it would be nice if we could all have $15 an hour for whatever, but would you rather live here, or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia? Do you really think the best way to make our society more Utopian is by importing displacement levels of Malays, Chinese, or Saudis?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhether you think the problem is genetic or cultural, it doesn't matter when you import immigrants in large numbers, because they form communities that don't integrate. They bring their language and their religion with them, and they vote for socialist policies. This will continue until white people have been sucked dry, and then there won't be any voting anymore, there'll be Sharia law instead. We're putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we're worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe didn't build all this shit and invent all this shit, our ancestors did--it's only ours to safeguard, not to flush down the toilet. You didn't get burned at the stake for saying something heretical, your ancestors did, so it's pretty fucking shameful if you're ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you. These fuckers have shifted everything so far out of wack and to not fight back now is the same thing as being on their side.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nComedy shouldn't be 'political'... Sensitive WASPy types don't like when things get publicly political. Sam Hyde is funny I just wish he wouldn't be 'political'... First of all, nobody even BATS A FUCKING EYE when Zach Galifianakis or Jim Carrey dips into some political issue that they know nothing about (because their views fall safely in the bubble of insanity that is societally accepted as 'OK'). Secondly.... THIS ISN'T EVEN POLITICAL! The slow smothering death of Western Civilization is not a political issue, it's a *historical issue*, as in we are toying with the fruits of 2000 years of bloody labor as if they're just piNata prizes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI don't want to shove politics in everyone's face all the time. I happen to think that free-market capitalism kicks socialism's ass and that spying and war are bad. I voted for Gary Johnson in 2012. If you think that a universal basic income is a good idea, or that weed should remain illegal, or think whatever about gay marriage, I don't care about those things enough to alienate viewers and I'm trying to shove my opinions in your face as little as possible. Even if you think that people are born boys and turn into girls, whatever, I think Bruce Jenner is really funny but I don't care enough to go beyond making jokes about ropes. But this isn't about politics, it's about having an identity and a home and not losing these beautiful civilizations that took so long to create.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe future is headed towards Cormac McCarthy's *The Road* and talking/thinking about it gives you an uh-oh boo-boo feeling in your tummy because someone might call you waycis? A lot of people have been hitting me up recently to ask about this, and everybody comes to the same conclusion, they agree and can see what's happening, but addressing it head-on gives them a no-no feeling, like a bad. They feel a bad, and they worry that people will think they're bad racers, shame no-no. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to start hating black people or using racial slurs or deliberately making yourself unpopular at parties, but whites need to regain some sort of cohesive tribal self-interest and identity right now *just like everybody else has* or in fifty years this country is going to be like Brazil (the bad parts, not the sexy babes and beaches and rich dudes in white linen suits). It's possible to have compassion for Third-Worlders, goodwill towards all mankind, respectful conversations with and attitudes towards people who don't look like you, and at the same time not want your own country to become a cesspit :) Sorry for getting all 'political', I'll go make some funny faces now!", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just speaking for myself (Sam)--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll always have anarchic/outsider sympathies/tendencies but... the SJW stuff and the diversity stuff have gone too far, past the point of no return. And I&amp;#39;m a super tolerant guy, I&amp;#39;m perfectly happy to have people screaming in my face and insulting me if that&amp;#39;s what it takes to have prosperity and a stable and fair society. But if you read enough of this shit you realize that&amp;#39;s not the endgame plan--the plan is to have anything white/masculine/traditional totally eliminated or suppressed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A year or two back, I might&amp;#39;ve said the most important issues were... surveillance, ending the war on drugs, campaign finance reform, military adventurism--something like that. But I&amp;#39;ve grown weary of having all this feminist nihilist shit plopped on my lap, and I&amp;#39;m tired of people telling me that I&amp;#39;ve got some original sin and the only way to cleanse myself is by acting like Tim Wise. Gamergate was eye-opening, #BlackLivesMatter was eye-opening, but what really drove the point home and crystalized this perspective was reading about things like Rotherham...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Europe is in a dire situation: culture is being destroyed, some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps, and a lot of these places might not ever be the same. I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a good thing, or a healthy thing, to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are 10-20x more likely to rape. I&amp;#39;m sorry I just don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s good, I know it&amp;#39;s insensitive as hell, but it&amp;#39;s too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently. This is just the way it is, Europe is being invaded and we&amp;#39;d better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate. Send them money, let them use the technology we invented, give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty, quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good, but by keeping borders open we&amp;#39;re taking the most productive, inventive, civilized, free countries and dumping them into the incinerator. Of course we have problems, of course the NSA is bad, of course it would be nice if we could all have $15 an hour for whatever, but would you rather live here, or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia? Do you really think the best way to make our society more Utopian is by importing displacement levels of Malays, Chinese, or Saudis?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you think the problem is genetic or cultural, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter when you import immigrants in large numbers, because they form communities that don&amp;#39;t integrate. They bring their language and their religion with them, and they vote for socialist policies. This will continue until white people have been sucked dry, and then there won&amp;#39;t be any voting anymore, there&amp;#39;ll be Sharia law instead. We&amp;#39;re putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we&amp;#39;re worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t build all this shit and invent all this shit, our ancestors did--it&amp;#39;s only ours to safeguard, not to flush down the toilet. You didn&amp;#39;t get burned at the stake for saying something heretical, your ancestors did, so it&amp;#39;s pretty fucking shameful if you&amp;#39;re ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you.

Some people see Sam as this evil curmudgeonly ogre who wants to lynch brown people and throw weed smokers &amp; gays into a volcano, but I don't think that's the case.
