You pay your monthly cashew budget to the government in taxes, now you don't have to hand them out yourself but you can no longer afford to help the poor without \"sacrificing your financial stability\"?\n\nSo really I think what we're getting at is you want people richer than you to pay more to people who make less than you. You will help the poor but only if you don't have to make sacrifices, cause you know, rich people have so much extra they wouldn't have to sacrifice much to give away 60-80% of their wealth. This is a pathological attitude. \n\nYou over-identify with the struggles of a class of people you know nothing about because you like the idea of struggling against some corrupt system and being the savior for a bunch of people who are worse off. Your whole \"Self Verification\" theory is just a way for you to strip them(and yourself) from having any agency. Wave away all the things they do to stay poor despite having free healthcare, free food, free housing, free education. All those poor people who break into the middle/upper class? Mistakes. Those 70% of wealthy families that lose it all by the 2nd generation?

[Self-verification theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-verification_theory) is incredibly interesting to me, because you can see it in all corners of human behavior.  People hold themselves to a standard that is very closely bound to their self-image.  There's a certain self-image necessary to not care about your health, and in the US it's far more pervasive in all classes than in many other western countries.  I think this has a lot to do with the anti-intellectualism.  Eating well is for gay leftist fags and physics professors.  This also relates to/descends into learned helplessness.\n\n&gt; There is no magic to getting a college degree than makes you more employable. \n\nAs someone who works in a technical profession and made an active effort to be successful without formal education, I can assure you that this is far from the truth.  The gatekeeping is retarded, HR is retarded, and everything about it is retarded.  If you're smart you can figure it out, but the median individual shouldn't be punished.  Paper talks, doesn't matter how retarded you are.  People far less skilled than me have gotten better jobs than me.\n\n&gt; The reason the average goon can't figure things out for themselves isn't poor education, it's because they lack the cognitive function to ever become self sufficient. It's a lack of ability not lack of education. It's been proven time and time again that increasing school funding doesn't do anything to improve outcomes. Administrations gobble that shit up\n\nSelf-verification + learned helplessness.  It's so much easier to fall into these traps in the US because being a low-skilled worker is far less rewarding.  Why is the average goon in so many other western countries still a functional member of society?  Because you are a functional member of society no matter what you do so long as you have a job.  Working at a convenience store does not mean you are relegated to a social circle of retail workers (extremely economically diverse adult social circles are far more common in nordic countries, for instance), and certainly doesn't mean you are significantly worse off than skilled workers.  In the US this type of \"MOVIN ON UP XD\" reinforcement has proven to be a facade for all but the most capable.\n\n&gt; but those countries haven't imported 90 million 3rd worlders since the 70's.\n\nI think this kind of plays into it in a different way.  I think the very fact that we have has distanced the lower class even more from being considered human.  In an alternate reality where people feel more emotionally invested in the lower class (because they seem more familiar), I think we would see much less social and economical stratification.\n\nBut hey, it's not like any of us are willing to do the manual labor, since that's poor mexican shit.\n\n&gt; How are European Americans doing compared to their European counterparts? African Americans compared to Africans? Mexican Americans compared to Mexicans? You'll see it's roughly the same or better in the case of Asians, Blacks and Hispanics. \n\nSo what you're saying is that people from shitty countries that end up in better countries (by their own means, not as slaves) tend to be only the most motivated and will invariably do better to begin with because it's a better country?  Holy shit.  I thought chinese people were just naturally mathematicians and doctors, not that their household of 15 people were all pooling together to send the kids to Cal Poly.  European americans still far exceed their european kin in being fat slobs that believe in magic, so I'd hesitate with that argument.\n\n&gt; But I think the first point I made was the most important. If you think poor people should have more free shit and you have more money than you know what to do with why aren't you giving it to them? \n\nBet you wish you could get me on that one.  It's not $1k a month, but it's something.\n\n&gt; Why aren't you paying for Juan's college education? You'll only have to pay 1 semester, maybe 2 max cause he's not gonna show up to class and his culture doesn't value education.\n\nI can't afford it.  I'm not going to sacrifice my own financial stability.  I'm utilitarian about all of this, which I think you fail to realize.  Poor people being more stable will make everyone else happier.  Moreover, it's not systematic.

They are overfed and Obese. \n\nThe average consumption of protein, vitamins, and minerals is virtually the same for poor and middle-class children and, in most cases, is well above recommended norms.

Most poor children today are, in fact, supernourished and grow up to be, on average, one inch taller and 10 pounds heavier than the GIs who stormed the beaches of Normandy in World War II.\n\nForty-three percent of all poor households actually own their own homes. The average home owned by persons classified as poor by the Census Bureau is a three-bedroom house with one-and-a-half baths, a garage, and a porch or patio.\n\nEighty percent of poor households have air conditioning.

(These comparisons are to the average citizens in foreign countries, not to those classified as poor.)\n\nNearly three-quarters of poor households own a car; 31 percent own two or more cars.\n\nNinety-seven percent of poor households have a color television; over half own two or more color televisions.\n\nSo I guess what I'm getting at here is your mischaracterization of the bottom 50-60% as the cutoff for comfortable living is total bullshit and you just pulled that number out of your asshole. The reason most people are struggling to make ends meet is because they are impulsive and stupid and spend money they don't have on things they don't need. They buy/rent places that are too expensive, they never save a dime, they spend all their money on drugs, alcohol, and entertainment and by the time they're done there's nothing left over.\n\nThey live in houses that are fucking disgusting because they don't clean. They have plenty of time to clean, the average poor family only works an average of 16 hours per week. It's because they really are stupid and lazy.\n\nI guess you've probably never really spent time with poor people, or maybe you just look down on them like shelter dogs at the humane society that need us Humans to provide for them(look at that poor subhuman getting foreclosed on because he skipped work for the 8th time in 2 months and got fired).\n\nWages for unskilled workers aren't going up because we keep importing unskilled workers for things that have to be done here like landscaping, construction, and farming, and exporting manufacturing. Women entering the workforce was also a major driver of keeping wages down. You can look at every field that once had a respectable salary, and as soon as women took over those roles in the corporate world wages decreased. It's called supply and demand.\n\nSee the thing is, your economic philosophy is just based on envy.
