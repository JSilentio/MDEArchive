I&amp;#39;m gonna make a game set in a future where transphobia/transism means hate of transhumans because transsexuals don&amp;#39;t exist (the stem cell vats can let you pick a gender several times in one lifespan)  and everyone has interbred until there are no discernible races, but we still have racism because the excelci-ites who live in the recharging dome (a literal game element) all get genetic modification that ends up making them &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same, &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; the same than the &amp;quot;natural depth grovelers&amp;quot; who still vary a little bit genetically despite all being the same race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;look ok guys we cant turn this sub into racism central. Have some self-awareness. That&amp;#39;s a huge part of the point of MDE. Dumb whites did elect Trump. You can&amp;#39;t sit here and be so fucking proud of us when 3/4 of our kids think they&amp;#39;re gonna be YouTube stars or artists or some shit and they&amp;#39;re all getting fat because we&amp;#39;re too pussy footed to get them to eat broccoli, or too fucking lazy ourselves to go through the shitty time consuming process necessary to guide a kid towards healthy eating choices without forcing it and turning it into an insecurity-based eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5j73ma/ny_times_solves_mystery_of_why_trump_won_too_many/dbe93i0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dbe93i0", "created": 1482210553.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1482181753.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5j73ma", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbeavy4", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LIGHTA-FLUID", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 0, "parent_id": "t3_5j73ma", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Less educated than the country as a whole, sure, but not dumber than niggas.

Mike Pompeo to be his CIA director, the President-elect's transition team announced Friday.*\n\n*\"He has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens,\" Trump said Friday in a statement. \"He will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies.\"*\n\n*Pompeo announced Friday evening that he accepted the nomination, saying in a statement that he's \"honored\" and \"humbled\" by the president-elect's decision.*\n\n*\"This was a difficult decision. I have genuinely loved representing the people of Kansas in Congress -- working to make our community stronger and more prosperous,\" he wrote. \"But ultimately the opportunity to lead the world's finest intelligence warriors, who labor tirelessly to keep this nation and Kansas safe, is a call to service I cannot ignore.\"*\n\n*Speaker John Boehner viewed him as a rising star and tapped him to serve on the House Intelligence Committee and the Select Committee on Benghazi, both posts that usually go to more senior members. He also got a coveted seat on the Energy and Commerce panel and has proposed measures regarding energy production.\nHe staked a tougher line on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton than some other Republicans. Pompeo was one of a handful of conservatives who argued House Benghazi committee chairman Trey Gowdy did not go far enough in his report on Clinton earlier this year.*\n\n***The Kansas lawmaker was a strong critic of the Iran nuclear deal*** and introduced several bills focused on security concerns about the Iranian government, including one bill raising concerns about the cooperation between Russia and Iran.*\n\n***Pompeo backed Sen. Marco Rubio in the primary and criticized Trump from the right, but later developed a relationship with the Trump campaign. The campaign called him every once in a while to get advice on key national security issues, and during the vice presidential debate, Pompeo was a surrogate for Vice President-elect Mike Pence.***\n\n*After the elections, Pompeo met with Trump, including earlier this week in New York where they talked about the job. Trump seems to have trusted his gut that Pompeo was best suited for the role.\nPompeo met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Pence, the leader of Trump's transition, at the Capitol Thursday. He declined to comment on their meeting as he left.*\n\n*The Kansas Republican becomes the first member of the House tapped by Trump, although Republican Reps. Jeb Hensarling and Tom Price both met with the President-elect this week and are being mentioned for other Cabinet positions.*\n\n***One of Pompeo's close friends and mentors on Capitol Hill was Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence panel. Rogers, who some considered as a possible pick for the CIA post, left the Trump transition team earlier this week after the President-elect removed those on the committee with ties to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.***\n\n*Democrats were quick to paint Pompeo as a member who touted the party line, a quality they worried about for a nominee for the top intelligence post.*\n\n***Before joining Congress, Pompeo graduated first in his class from the US Military Academy at West Point. Pompeo was a classmate of Sen. Ted Cruz's at Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review -- although he declined to support Cruz in the Republican primaries.***\n\n*The selection of Pompeo rounds out a trio of national security picks Trump has made -- including Sen.
