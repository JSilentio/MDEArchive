I have no idea precisely how others perceive me and can&amp;#39;t be bothered to dwell anymore. I am powering toward bigger goals, goals I could not have even put into perspective five years ago. I am cushioned in my adulthood by the labour I have done to make myself happy. I have committed to my happiness and sacrificed for it. I feel loved.
