those who are familiar with mathematics (like as in mathematical proofs) would appreciate his reasoning. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof\n\n&gt;The proof uses modal logic, which distinguishes between necessary truths and contingent truths. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many \"possible worlds\" are considered. A truth is necessary if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is contingent if it just happens to be the case. For instance, \"more than half of this planet is covered by water\" is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet \"this planet\" is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, the proof uses higher-order (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.[8]\n\n&gt;First, G\u00f6del axiomatizes the notion of a \"positive property\":[note 2] for each property \u03c6, either \u03c6 or its negation \u00ac\u03c6 must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property \u03c6 implies a property \u03c8 in each possible world, then \u03c8 is positive, too (axiom 1). G\u00f6del then argues that each positive property is \"possibly exemplified\", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3),[note 3] G\u00f6del shows that in some possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called \"God\" in the following.[note 4] G\u00f6del proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in every possible world.\n\n&gt;To this end, he defines essences: if x is an object in some world, then a property \u03c6 is said to be an essence of x if \u03c6(x) is true in that world and if \u03c6 necessarily entails all other properties that x has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), G\u00f6del can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, x is said to exist necessarily if, for every essence \u03c6 of x, there is an element y with property \u03c6 in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.\n\n&gt;Hence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3, a few other axioms from modal logic[clarification needed] were tacitly used in the proof.\n\n&gt;From these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the identity of indiscernibles: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. G\u00f6del did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness.\n\nI know you're really edgy and stuff, but if you could take your bullshit back to /r/atheism, that would be great. I'm not about to have a discussion about my own religious beliefs, nor am I about to tell you what to believe. \n\nYou obviously don't know what the fuck the proof even says or means, so why don't you educate yourself before acting like a bitch?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/q1jYMLv.png", "edited": 1508985004.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well seeing as how he was a Mathematician, and his argument is based in the same axiomatic manner proofs are written, those who are familiar with mathematics (like as in mathematical proofs) would appreciate his reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The proof uses modal logic, which distinguishes between necessary truths and contingent truths. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many &amp;quot;possible worlds&amp;quot; are considered. A truth is necessary if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is contingent if it just happens to be the case. For instance, &amp;quot;more than half of this planet is covered by water&amp;quot; is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet &amp;quot;this planet&amp;quot; is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the proof uses higher-order (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.[8]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, G\u00f6del axiomatizes the notion of a &amp;quot;positive property&amp;quot;:[note 2] for each property \u03c6, either \u03c6 or its negation \u00ac\u03c6 must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property \u03c6 implies a property \u03c8 in each possible world, then \u03c8 is positive, too (axiom 1). G\u00f6del then argues that each positive property is &amp;quot;possibly exemplified&amp;quot;, i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3),[note 3] G\u00f6del shows that in some possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; in the following.[note 4] G\u00f6del proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in every possible world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this end, he defines essences: if x is an object in some world, then a property \u03c6 is said to be an essence of x if \u03c6(x) is true in that world and if \u03c6 necessarily entails all other properties that x has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), G\u00f6del can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3).
