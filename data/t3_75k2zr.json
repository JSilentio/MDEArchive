that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the thing is, if you make fun of someone, if its funny, its because it says something about life in a broader way. so say you make fun of mike brown or some other person who got killed by a cop. if its funny, its not because you are making fun of that person as an individual, but you are making fun of something they are connected to that resonates on a larger scale with society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this is why sam hydes twitter comedy stand up is my favourite work of his, the one where he basically rants about negative facts about gays. he&amp;#39;s making fun of the perception of gays and disadvantaged groups as flawless and innocent angels unfit for any criticism. he&amp;#39;s really making fun of everyone for acting like its totally a sin worth imprisonment or exhile to say anything negative about disadvantaged groups or individuals as if they are perfect. he&amp;#39;s basically actually just making fun of the whole idea of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t punch down&amp;quot; in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;because if you think about it, if you are making fun of people as representitive of a group, alot of these &amp;quot;disadvantaged&amp;quot; groups aren&amp;#39;t actually that helpless in society and actually have an incredibly amount of power to direct society. maybe you can argue that a specific black person or a specific gay person doesn&amp;#39;t, but black people and gay people as a whole, as a cultural idea, and their perception, absolutely do. it changes policy, it changes society, for everyone else. just look at affirmative action, look at the rate of fatherless black people, look at the crime, look at the mental health, suicide rate, drug use, and std rate of the gay community. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i think that its important to &amp;quot;punch down&amp;quot; in comedy. because most of society falls under the category of people that if you make fun of them you are &amp;quot;punching down&amp;quot;, and if people avoid ever getting made fun of, they become assholes that destroy society because they never get reminded that they have flaws and they are wrong for thinking their shit doesn&amp;#39;t stink. also, by them avoiding any sort of negativity, they are just making them selves incredibly fragile and more prone to being completely destroyed when they do face any sort of negativity. so by &amp;quot;not punching down&amp;quot;, you are actually making disadvantaged people more disadvantaged, you are making them weaker, and you are also not treating them like are human beings like any other just as worthy of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if i&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;disadvantaged&amp;quot; group member, i want you to punch down at me, because i
