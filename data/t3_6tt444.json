It's extremely important to understand the difference between the original communist revolutionaries (Lenin, Trotsky, etc.) and Stalin. Lenin's gang was kind of like our modern left - they had all these wacky Marxist ideas, including unrealistic economical practices, sexual liberation, hatred for Christianity, feminism, egalitarianism etc. Jews were massively overrepresented in their ranks. They realized that they need an apparatus of state terror when the Russian population wouldn't play ball and agree to all that shit. Lenin actually got pretty pragmatic and quickly realised that this shit simply doesn't work, especially the economical aspect - hence the New Economic Policy, kind of a weird state-controlled attempt at capitalism. All these concessions didn't sit well with the hardcore communist ideologues (Trotsky's gang).\n\nAfter Lenin died, Stalin took over. As usual, in a totalitarian state, it's inevitable that the most bloodthirsty tyrant gets into power eventually. Not that Lenin had much regard for human life in the first place. Now, Stalin was the ultimate statist, and hence a nationalist. He realized that you can NOT run a country with all this leftist bullshit. Stalin had very little regard for Marxist ideology, he didn't care about the idea of communism - he cared about being in charge of a military superpower set to conquer Europe and the world. Therefore, he quickly did away with all the Marxist ideological points which he viewed as obstacles:\n\n- He engaged in foreign trade with the capitalists - he sold whatever resources he could muster (e.g. Ukrainian grain, this killed about 6 million people, the forgotten 6 million, read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor). He was then able to quickly industrialize the country (he build Ford factories in the USSR)\n- He recriminalized homosexuality and other deviation, recognizing that these groups have outlived their purpose: toppling the old system and bringing about a new one. He realized that they are always in opposition to society by nature, and are now only a nuisance.\n- He sought to revivify tradition (quote from wiki: Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort and presented Russia as a defender of Christian civilization, because he saw the church had an ability to arouse the people in a way that the party could not and because he wanted western help).\n- In the same way, he needed to rebuilt the work ethic in a demoralized society (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement). Marxism aims at destroying the very fundaments of productivity (traditional work ethic) and so something needed to be done to counteract that. It was actually reasonably successful.\n- As with the sexual minorities, he recognized that the internationalist communists were a significant obstacle in his goal of creating a powerul state. I remember when I first learned about this, I thought it was very strange how being the wrong kind of communist carried the death pentaly, but it makes sense. Many old-school communist Jews were just that (obviously they wouldn't go along with Stalin's nationalism etc.), they were Marxist ideologues while Stalin was a pragmatist who wanted to use the existing system to achieve his own ends - and for that he needed to modify it, and he did so with no regard for the ideological underpinnings, because he rightly recognized them as absurd.", "edited": 1502799236.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, your second image is a wartime Nazi propaganda poster.

Now, Stalin was the ultimate statist, and hence a nationalist. He realized that you can NOT run a country with all this leftist bullshit. Stalin had very little regard for Marxist ideology, he didn&amp;#39;t care about the idea of communism - he cared about being in charge of a military superpower set to conquer Europe and the world. Therefore, he quickly did away with all the Marxist ideological points which he viewed as obstacles:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He engaged in foreign trade with the capitalists - he sold whatever resources he could muster (e.g. Ukrainian grain, this killed about 6 million people, the forgotten 6 million, read &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor&lt;/a&gt;). He was then able to quickly industrialize the country (he build Ford factories in the USSR)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He recriminalized homosexuality and other deviation, recognizing that these groups have outlived their purpose: toppling the old system and bringing about a new one. He realized that they are always in opposition to society by nature, and are now only a nuisance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He sought to revivify tradition (quote from wiki: Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort and presented Russia as a defender of Christian civilization, because he saw the church had an ability to arouse the people in a way that the party could not and because he wanted western help).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the same way, he needed to rebuilt the work ethic in a demoralized society (&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement&lt;/a&gt;). Marxism aims at destroying the very fundaments of productivity (traditional work ethic) and so something needed to be done to counteract that. It was actually reasonably successful.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As with the sexual minorities, he recognized that the internationalist communists were a significant obstacle in his goal of creating a powerul state. I remember when I first learned about this, I thought it was very strange how being the wrong kind of communist carried the death pentaly, but it makes sense. Many old-school communist Jews were just that (obviously they wouldn&amp;#39;t go along with Stalin&amp;#39;s nationalism etc.), they were Marxist ideologues while Stalin was a pragmatist who wanted to use the existing system to achieve his own ends - and for that he needed to modify it, and he did so with no regard for the ideological underpinnings, because he rightly recognized them as absurd.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6tt444/some_soviet_era_artpropaganda_was_pretty_killer/dlnc7pu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dlnc7pu", "created": 1502824277.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1502795477.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6tt444", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6tt444", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dlndf63", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "depehb", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dlnbgoj", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "see my response below (or above)", "edited": 1502802059.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;see my response below (or above)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6tt444/some_soviet_era_artpropaganda_was_pretty_killer/dlndf63/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dlndf63", "created": 1502826813.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1502798013.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dlnbgoj", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "12_f_taiwan", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dlnalme", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "What year this poster is?
