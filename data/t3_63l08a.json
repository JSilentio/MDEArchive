Do you think that information was \"readily available\" in Ethiopia of all places when the communist takeover was happening?\n\nI didn't say all of Africa was inhospitable, and specifically mentioned the south wasn't. No doubt the inhabitants didn't do as good a job at farming as the far more advanced colonizers. I already mentioned  the reasons for tribal warfare. \n\nOut of curiosity, where on the intellect scale would you place the ancient Semitic tribes who kept fighting with one another in Old Testament times?\n\nI guarantee you that all humans (and the apes we descended from) are genetically predisposed to violence and tribalism. It's just we've gotten used to having a comfortable life. Faced with imminent starvation, you'd be behaving very differently. Look up what people did during the great hunger in eastern Ukraine. I wonder if you consider that particular famine proof of the Ukrainians' low intelligence, for having allowed Stalin into power.\n\nI wrote about how I think Asians recovered from colonization in my previous message.\n\nI'm not denying that a lower intelligence is detrimental to a society.

Ethiopia had never once been colonized. Crime is still rampant. Standard of living still miserable. Notorious for suffering a massive famine. Yes, I mentioned Ethiopia. You mentioned that poor leadership in Ethiopia leads to their plight citing 'collectivization.' Again, who makes these piss poor decisions? Guess what, it's Ethiopians. Government is typically a loose reflection on the will of a nation's people. Norway's love for socialism is something born out of the people of Norway's desire for a state that provides and cares for its citizens. America's heavy support for gun rights in high level government is a reflection on the common American value of the right to bare arms. If your nation is full of morons, they will naturally push for moronic legislative practices and political leadership that leads to mismanagement. All you've done is prove my point that Ethiopians fucked up their own country with bad economics. \n\nI want you to ask yourself, why was Sub-Saharan Africa so vulnerable and easy to colonize by the major European powers? Why was it so easy for Europeans to claim almost all of Sub Saharan Africa for themselves? Why is it so easy for the Soviet Union to set up communist puppet states? Why is it so easy for the Chinese to essentially turn East Africa into their own personal mineral mining operations? Seriously, consider this. The people of Africa were nothing more than inefficient hunters and gatherers before Europeans arrived and drew up borders, with few African tribes and societies actually developing any form of agriculture or advanced technologies to defend themselves from foreign invaders. Typically if you're lagging behind your peers, wouldn't that make you a possible candidate for being a dimwit? Again, you act as if colonization is somehow to blame for bloodthirsty warlords like Liberia's own General Buttnaked the cannibal (not satire, google it). India and The United States were both once under colonial influence. The former is developing into a world superpower and is about to supplant the Chinese. The latter is already THE world superpower with the largest military force in the world AND the world's reserve currency. Meanwhile Africa fails to feed their populations and gradually relies on more and more foreign aid to sustain themselves. Again, you're blaming whitey for Haiti's plight. They've had 200 FUCKING YEARS. Do you understand that? Cuba has been independent from the Spaniards for much less than that and has accomplished much more than their black, French-speaking, Caribbean brothers. Vietnam was once colonized by the French, believe it or not, and they're also gradually developing massive industry akin to the early growth of industrial China. Why is it that virtually every black nation fails to do the same?\n\nYou continue to discuss corruption in local government, as well. How do these blatantly corrupt local officials get in their positions in the first place? It's almost like the black population don't give a shit or are too dumb to give a shit. Yes, many will vote for free shit, but I don't see many blacks springing for the libertarian or conservative parties. In fact, libertarian and republican voter turnout is mainly white. Blacks are an extreme minority when it comes to any ideals that advocate for the downsizing of government bureaucracy. White America also has many uneducated retards promising free shit; the difference being that white America generally doesn't vote for the \"Everything should be free parties.\" You even proved my point though, when you stated that the unskilled and uneducated groups will vote for shitty politics. Wouldn't you consider a lack of skills and a lack of education to be a signal that a person may be of lower intelligence? \n\nOh wow, how weird.

I find it funny though. You have an answer for everything. Ethiopia sucks? It's communism. Detroit sucks? It's a residual effect from slavery. The Congo sucks? Colonization had left everything in chaos. Haiti sucks? Must be those damn French people. Isn't it weird, you could change every factor but the result is almost always the same: Shitty countries with shitty culture and shitty standards of living. There is one factor that always remains the same, though. Let me give you a hint: It's the people that live in these places. \n\nYeah, and you're European. Not surprising in the least.

Ethiopia had never once been colonized. Crime is still rampant. Standard of living still miserable. Notorious for suffering a massive famine. Yes, I mentioned Ethiopia. You mentioned that poor leadership in Ethiopia leads to their plight citing &amp;#39;collectivization.&amp;#39; Again, who makes these piss poor decisions? Guess what, it&amp;#39;s Ethiopians. Government is typically a loose reflection on the will of a nation&amp;#39;s people. Norway&amp;#39;s love for socialism is something born out of the people of Norway&amp;#39;s desire for a state that provides and cares for its citizens. America&amp;#39;s heavy support for gun rights in high level government is a reflection on the common American value of the right to bare arms. If your nation is full of morons, they will naturally push for moronic legislative practices and political leadership that leads to mismanagement. All you&amp;#39;ve done is prove my point that Ethiopians fucked up their own country with bad economics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want you to ask yourself, why was Sub-Saharan Africa so vulnerable and easy to colonize by the major European powers? Why was it so easy for Europeans to claim almost all of Sub Saharan Africa for themselves? Why is it so easy for the Soviet Union to set up communist puppet states? Why is it so easy for the Chinese to essentially turn East Africa into their own personal mineral mining operations? Seriously, consider this. The people of Africa were nothing more than inefficient hunters and gatherers before Europeans arrived and drew up borders, with few African tribes and societies actually developing any form of agriculture or advanced technologies to defend themselves from foreign invaders. Typically if you&amp;#39;re lagging behind your peers, wouldn&amp;#39;t that make you a possible candidate for being a dimwit? Again, you act as if colonization is somehow to blame for bloodthirsty warlords like Liberia&amp;#39;s own General Buttnaked the cannibal (not satire, google it). India and The United States were both once under colonial influence. The former is developing into a world superpower and is about to supplant the Chinese. The latter is already THE world superpower with the largest military force in the world AND the world&amp;#39;s reserve currency. Meanwhile Africa fails to feed their populations and gradually relies on more and more foreign aid to sustain themselves. Again, you&amp;#39;re blaming whitey for Haiti&amp;#39;s plight. They&amp;#39;ve had 200 FUCKING YEARS. Do you understand that? Cuba has been independent from the Spaniards for much less than that and has accomplished much more than their black, French-speaking, Caribbean brothers. Vietnam was once colonized by the French, believe it or not, and they&amp;#39;re also gradually developing massive industry akin to the early growth of industrial China. Why is it that virtually every black nation fails to do the same?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You continue to discuss corruption in local government, as well.
