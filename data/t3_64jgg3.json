A lot of people over there view dope in the same way people over at r/trees view weed. Granted, the majority of the sub's users over on r/opiates were like myself and simply were upfront about being an overall piece of shit and admitted that our heroin usage was problematic right off rip. Regardless, even if one out of 10 threads were glorifying heroin usage, it still becomes a problem when 10+ people are also commenting something that along the lines of \"Yeah OP, me too! Bout to bang this speedball out and watch some Rick and Morty. Hopefully my Dad doesn't come home and realize I sold his watch today, otherwise it's gonna ruin my nod lmfao!\"\n\n\nIt reinforces the idea that one can possibly live a happy life as an addict for those who don't know any better, like myself at 16.
