A heavier breakfast can help in those cases.  \n\nPerhaps he does come out of his depth sometimes and comment on things that are beyond his field, but I don't think he should shy from voicing his opinion.  I think that on the whole he is trying to offer an antidote to the growing issue of nihilism and the thinking that preceded communism in Russia. \n\nThe importance of what he is addressing is so monumental that I don't think he should be disregarded because of the errors that he makes.  The fundamental issue is the issue of truth, which he addresses in his book.  This issue - if not addressed (and if there is not a revolution of some sort) - will likely to lead again to the death and suffering of millions.  \n\nThere are many great minds who are not all around perfect.\n\nBy the way, that meme you shared about his argument with Sam Harris is wrong.  Sam never once addressed the root of the issue which is that you cannot get an ought from an is.  Jordan was trying to describe the importance of wisdom (truth) in relation to the world as a forum for action.  He was not denying science's place.  Sam, on the other hand, thinks that science can solve all of our problems.  It can't.

It seems like he just got popular because he marketed himself well or something.  What even does this guy bring to the table. He just kinda spams up my twitter feed with garbage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meh&amp;quot; Tier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stefan Molyneux - irritating clickbait thumbnails, shrouded in an aura of arrogance.  However, I have learned quite a bit from him and he&amp;#39;s clearly really intelligent, so I don&amp;#39;t mind him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Styxexenhammer - Don&amp;#39;t really watch his vids but he seems like an alright guy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lauren Southern - Has some pretty funny video&amp;#39;s but isn&amp;#39;t particularly almond activating&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gavin McInnes - Meh content, kinda funny&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Top Tier -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jordan Peterson - if he counts.  He&amp;#39;s not really focused on politics but he clearly is conservative and it shows in his material.  His lectures on his main channel are top tier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dave Rubin - he&amp;#39;s actually a liberal, or &amp;quot;classical liberal,&amp;quot; but he has plenty of conservative guests and has long, informative discussions with people on both sides.  Great, balanced content. Not an echo chamber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I can&amp;#39;t stand most hardcore right wing youtubers, other than Sam, ofc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true,
