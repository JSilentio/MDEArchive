If you are possible at all, you will be possible again. Whatever \"you\" is. I have a theory that the only difference between \"you\" and \"me\" is the brains that drive our experience. Sometimes we think it's obvious that we haven't been before because we would remember it, right? But nobody is talking about some \"immortal incorporeal soul that has memories\". You need brains to have memories. You dont remember before because your brain doesn't have the memories of before. You feel as though you are you rather than me simply because I have a different brain. Imagine one person controlling various sock puppets, but each sock puppet had its own brain so that the puppet master only experiences each hand puppet from its own perspective. I also believe that at any given moment we die and live, but do not \"feel it\". For example, take the \"Star Trek teleporter paradox\" where people say \"uhm, isn't the machine actually just killing you and then creating a clone of you in the ship?\". The answer is yes, and the clone doesn't feel it because it's brain has the information of right where it left off without a beat. This same thing is actually going on an innumerable amount of times in our own brains. On the surface level, you have chemical reactions, proteins etc that change the state of the brain. If what \"you\" are is just the current state of your brain, then clones of you are constantly being destroyed and created. At the smaller level, you have quarks and matter fluctuating in and out of existence an innumerable amount of times per second. When you move in space time, your atomic arrangement changed to get you to the new location, and so on. There is no \"you\" or \"me\". Just \"current state\" but we don't feel it the same way the person getting beamed up in Star Trek does t feel it. The information in the brain tells us we have been us all along until the next current state is told he is the person that has been all along. This is the conclusion I came to when debating whether we come back as the same person next time. I realized it was a meaningless question as it had a priori implications. It makes more sense that we are everything, i.e. \"You\" come back as everything in every possible circumstance. \"You\" are the leaf with no brain, and so doesn't \"feel it\". You are the cow with a brain, so \"you\" feel that. \"But I don't remember being a cow\", you're going back to the \"soul/spirit\" fallacy. You dint remember it because the brain \"you\" have doesn't have cow memories in it. If \"you\" had some brain accident where you lost all of your memories, you would still be \"you\". This means that \"you\" are not your memories either. If you would still be \"you\" with half your brain missing, why can you be \"you\" with a cow brain, or a puerto rican female that was born in 1953, or a leaf that will exist in 2027, or a car today? To test whether you really believe that there is something to \"you\" other than your current brain state, ask yourself this question, would you behave like you or like your mom if they were to transfer her brain into you?\n\nThe bad news is that it means you will suffer all the suffering that has existed (being born as everything). The good news is that (assuming sentient life continues to exist), suffering is probably going to exist only in the early part of the universes' history as sentient life will inevitably solve suffering. This means that in the grand scheme, 99999999 to the power of 9999999999 years of bliss for every 2 million of suffering. \n\nThat's for a creator-less universe. If the universe has a creator, then you can be a unique being that may only exist once, or be brought back. Evidence for a created universe is thusly: Birth lottery. In a creator-less universe, \"existence\" is infinite. This can mean one timeline that goes on infinitely, or one that loops etc. The un-created universe is very long in age. In the un created universe, it is logical to presume that in a thousand years, life/humans/new-humans will still exist. Same for a billion or 30 trillion. Even if life on this earth failed, there are other planets etc, and so a civilization that is 30 trillion years advanced is expected to exist. In fact, several of them. Trillions of them. In such a universe/reality, what are your odds of being born before the year 3000ad? 1 in trillions times trillions? The fact that I was born here rather than in the year 47,000,000,000,000 is an evidence of a created/young, or un-eternal universe. The reasoning I have is that regardless of what the likelihood is that the universe has a creator, it is probably higher than the 1 in trillions times trillions. This means that a created universe is a more likely explanation to having been born in the astronomically small sliver of time before death and disease were cured, and before we had made contact with other intelligent life, than sheer bad luck. It's tempting to then simply solve the problem by saying \"well, this particular brain-state that makes up who I am, could only have been the one in this time and place, so I was always doomed to miss the paradise stage\". It's tempting until you realize that there is no reason your particular set of genes could not exist 20 million years down the road. For all you know, at some point, neo-humans decide to recreate every possible human than can exist to let them enjoy paradise as well. These are the 2 possibilities for reality I have deduced. Each one can branch of course (for example \"creator universe\" could have a God creator, or a non-deity creator such as what we perceive as reality being a VR experience created by humans, created by other intelligent life etc), but these are the 2 main branches \n\n1) infinite universe- we always exist for better or worse.\n\n2) created universe- finite and options exist for death, such as either coming back, or vanishing for ever.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is no God, then the only logical possibility is that you will exist again simply due to the fact that you have existed at least once.
