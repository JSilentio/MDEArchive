I had started going to a ton of local gigs around Boston (where I'm from) to get involved in the culture. I had been going alone, no friends or anything. Now around October I had met this dude named \"Da Corporation.\" He had worked with other Boston MCs like Young Bean and O.T.O. This dude was young and real cool, we became good homies. Now back to February. Corp had been contacted by Daniel Weisman (Bill Nye's manager) or one of his representatives and asked to open for him at a show in New Haven. Corp asked if I wanted to join him. I really fucked with Bill Nye's show so I said yeah. Why not. Free show. My dude is performing.  \n\nOkay, flash to the show. We had been on a long ass road trip, we were hungry as hell. But we didn't have any time to grab anything. This one dude named David or Davion said the team (Bill Nye and people) were going to go get food after and we could join them. I was like hell yeah. eatin dinner with Bill Nye. That'll be sick.\n\nCorp killed it. Got the crowd jumpin and everything. I was hyped. Bill Nye came through later and I expected him to do something like say my friend did a good job or something but nah. He didn't say shit he came out and started performing. I was like whatever and started jamming.  \n\nAfter the show. We follow that Davion dude to Bill Nye's bus and ask where we're going. Then some white dude says that they're going to get pizza and to hang tight and that Bill Nye is in the back we can chill. So we go to the back, say hey. He says nothing. My friend sits down next to him, I sit down across from him. Bill is just texting. I didn't want to be an asshole so my friend and I just started talking about random shit like the trip or or comic books or how dope the show was (Bill couldn't hear us). Then my friend slides over and tries to dap Bill and talks about how much he loved his show and he was honored to perform. Now let me tell you this part is completely true. Bill looks up from his phone, stares my friend in the eye as he's speaking, then says \"shut the fuck up\" literally fifteen times in a row. My friend already shut up from the first one. Wale shakes his head like he's disgusted or something then looks back at his phone. My friend was in shock. He didn't expect that at all. He moved over to sit next to me instead so Bill was alone on the couch with a few girls and some dude we didn't know. We started talking again waiting for the food and Bill looks up and asks \"you two know what shut the fuck up mean?\" the girls start laughing and i make a \"wtf\" face. Bill shakes his head and laughs at me. Saying I look retarded. And that my friend was a wack performer.  \n\nCorp didn't want to start shit so he kept his head down and stayed quiet. I was pissed off. I asked Bill why he would invite Da Corporation if he didn't think he was good. Bill just shrugged and said he didn't even know about it. I was shaking my head and began whispering to Corp about how Bill was a bitch. I think Bill noticed me talking shit because he came over and started me in my eyes. Like he was gonna fuckin kill me. He told us to get the fuck out and Corp managed to say that we were waiting for the pizza. Bill said \"aint no pizza. get out\"  \n\nSo we did. We had no food and no place to stay so we just slept in Corp's cousin's car (he drove it up there) then drove back to Boston the next morning. He kinda stopped performing after that and we don't talk much.  \n\nBasically, Bill Nye is an asshole. My friend was trying to give him props on a show and Bill just told him to shut up. We didn't even do anything. Kinda sad really.  \n\nEveryone on reddit was asking me about it saying I'm just talking shit. I'm not. This is real shit and I'm sure someone else who has met the dude can say the same thing.
