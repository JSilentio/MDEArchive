I\u2019ve been in this stupid mall for over two hours now (millions\nof zombies after New Years buying sprees). Think I\u2019ll just sit down on this\nbench here and take a load off my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ah there. That\u2019s better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don\u2019t even know why I came here. The wife is off trying to buy\nsome shoes. That\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll let her drag me along on one of these\nlittle shopping excursions. Well, what the heck? Might as well check the\npeople out. That\u2019s always amusing. Funny, I used to work in this dumb place\nlike 25 years ago. Selling clothes at the Gap. Hmmm. Let\u2019s see.. what\u2019s\ndifferent about the people today?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. Well, one thing for sure. The costumes are way different. Good\nLord! Whoever designed this stuff should be shot! Major ugly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least back when I was a teenager, guys looked like guys and girls looked\nlike girls. Today, I swear, it\u2019s just the opposite. Guys look like a bunch\nof sissies. Earrings, pony tails \u2014 the whole bit. I mean, you can\u2019t even\ntell the fake homosexuals from the real ones! And how come so many of the\nwomen/girls are wearing those short Nazi haircuts! Achtung! Besides that, a\nlot of the older ones are wearing suits! Man, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing\u2019s for sure. Clothes today are uglier than they\u2019ve ever been\nduring my lifetime. I mean, they are actually selling people junk \u2014 shirts\nwith holes in them, old bags shaped like pants or dresses. And these\nnumbskulls are paying beaucoup bucks for this crap! Well, too bad for them.\nPeople have always been fodder for those evil flesh maggots called fashion\ndesigners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that gets me today are the hairdos. Sure,\nhair-consciousness has always been \u201cin\u201d but never before have I seen such\nhideous haircuts! Are these people serious? Don\u2019t they ever look in the\nmirror and feel embarrassed? Little patches cut out of the sides of their\nheads, horrible scraggly curls hanging all over the place \u2014 17 different\nlengths of hair, girls whose heads look like they got caught in the\nMixmaster...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst, by far is the one that guys are wearing. You know, the one\nwhere it\u2019s long on top and then the sides are shaved with a bowl. That one\u2019s\nreal popular. And by now, the male ponytail has become de rigeur. Balding\nguys with gray hair are running around in ponytails. It\u2019s disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something worse than terrible styles has happened. I can\u2019t quite put\nit into words. I guess the closest I can come is that it has to do with the\nzeal with which people today shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are some stone, serious shoppers. They shop as if their very lives\ndepended on it. It\u2019s nuts! Don\u2019t they realize that time is wasting? Don\u2019t\nthey ever stop and think that they\u2019re going to die?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that\u2019d be fun. I\u2019d like to get on the house PA system and...\n\u201cAttention shoppers! I just want to remind you that at this very second your\nbodies are rotting and that sometime in the very near future you will be\ndead!\u201d Put that in your high-top Reeboks, suckers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you know what? I doubt if it\u2019d make one bit of difference. No sir \u2014\nif ever there were a brainwashed bunch of pods, it\u2019s these Mall People. What\u2018s\npositively frightening is that this very same scene is taking place in\nmalls across the country. No \u2014 the world! A nation of mall-mutants! A global\nMall Culture! It\u2019s actually happened!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A brief digression. Do you remember a book that came out some years back called The Peter Pan Syndrome? It was another one of those stupid self-help books \u2014 one which dealt in particular with people who (according to the book\u2019s author) refuse to \u201cgrow up.\u201d I never bought the bloody thing, I just gave it a quick read while standing in the bookstore. It was chock full of the standard psychological gobbledygook \u2014 how people with the \u201csyndrome\u201d live lives of fantasy, how they refuse to accept the responsibilities which would constitute them becoming \u201cadults,\u201d you know, all that sort of hooey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I stood there reading, I continued to grow more angry by the moment. Sure, I recognized a lot of the Peter Pan Syndrome\u2019s symptoms in myself.. but so what!? These damn psychiatrists were always so free when they flung about terms like \u201cadulthood,\u201d \u201cmaturity\u201d and \u201creality,\u201d as if any of those words actually had any discernible meaning (outside of the author\u2019s personal opinion).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I figure it is this: as long as I pay my bills..  as long as I manage to deal with the plethora of numbskulls, dunderheads, jerks and morons who I have to put up with each and every day (through no choice of my own) without erupting into screaming, babbling fits of frenzy.. as long as I make it through the day without running down the streets throwing grenades at people or slitting the throats of the countless backbiting, vicious, mean-spirited, soulless swine who have no other purpose on this earth but to make life lousy... as long as I do that, then I\u2019m dealing with reality just fine, thank you. And I certainly don\u2019t need some half-bright gimp with a few letters after his name telling me that I need to \u201cgrow up\u201d ... whatever the hell that means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to get excited, but books like that really bug me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, I\u2019ve been sitting here for 40 minutes now and I have not seen one\nsingle normal person. Not one. Just this endless parade of demon-possessed\nShopping Zombies. Please God, just give me one regular person \u2014 one of those\nold guys wearing plaid burgundy pants, white shoes and a matching belt. Or a\nfat lady in a muu-muu. Something! I can\u2019t take this much longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just noticed something else. There are no kids anymore! What I mean is,\nall the kids today look like miniature adults. Six-year-old girls are\nwalking around with lipstick, eyeliner and frizzed-out hair. Then you look\nat their parents \u2014 especially the mothers \u2014 and they\u2019re all trying to be\nteenagers! It\u2019s too horrible! Besides, there\u2019s nothing sadder than some old\nbroad trying to dress like a 16-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who are the kids emulating today? Ice-T? Puff Daddy? Ariana Grande?\nGimme a break! These jerks don\u2019t have any style. They\u2019re just human\nmannequins outfitted by the fashion police!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another funny thing is the names of the stores in this place! Sovage..\nAldo.. Lacoste.. Maje..
