A lot of them that left around the time of fall of USSR are regretting their decision as US/CAN/AUS/NZ/UK/GER are becoming leftist hellholes. Getting out used to be a straightforward decision that nobody really disagreed with because people wanted to escape socialist poverty and political repression. Now the tables have turned. Obama / Clinton were against same sex marriage in 2012, yet if you oppose genderless bathrooms everywhere your homophobic?! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assimilation is tricky in multicultural societies, because the national identity is always in flux. Its one thing to follow the law, pay taxes, pay lip service to community building etc. but I just don&amp;#39;t think a lot of immigrants feel patriotic in the same way as people that stayed in their country of origin.

If you wish to do business with a multinational or government entity you have to be 54% black owned.\n\nMost black owned business survives on grants from the government and/or corruptly procured tenders.\nWe have a luxury department store, Luminance, and an online radio station, TouchHD, which have been funded by government's \"development\"  money and  have run at a loss for their entire existence.\nAlso, 80% of the development money and loans made by government isn't returned.\n\nThe government is provably riddled with capture, corruption and cronyism yet Whites are blamed for the majority of the country's problems.\nThe national airline has been bankrupt for years.\nThe power provider is expensive and often has load-shedding.\nRoads agency and postal company are utter failures.\nThe police are corrupt and bribes can be used to get out of pretty much anything (Roadblocks when drunk or speeding can cost from a can of cold drink to R1000 or whatever shopping you have in the boot. Spousal abuse charges, assault charges, burglary charges and excessive speeding charges can all be dropped for around R5000 to R25000. High profile cases like celebrity crimes, murder or rape can have dockets lost or blood work contaminated for R100k to R500k - this is fairly common knowledge and several people I know have had the charges they pressed mysteriously dropped or have paid a bribe to have charges dropped)\nPublic schools are terrible and pass rates are low despite the fact that 30% is the pass mark.\n\n\nI could go on, but what's most important to understand is the following:\nMost of the things mentioned impact blacks more than Whites.\nWhites rely on private: Security, Hospitals, Schools, Electricity and Water (in part) bc we know the gov isn't there for us. But with blacks the govt **is** there for them and yet education, infrastructure and opportunity has gotten worse for them. This is because the underlying factor of all RSA's ills is the fact that blacks lack the ability to be civic minded and struggle with resisting short term gain in favour of long term profit.\n\nThere are several instances where tenders meant to build 1000s of low cost houses resulted in the erection of 5-10 houses and the developer takes off with the rest of the cash. Then, the houses that are eventually developed are given to friends of administrators who then rent the houses out - mainly to African foreigners.\n\nSeveral things occur for this exact thing to happen and each occurrence is underpinned by a lack of civic mindedness.\n\nTender officer: could give job to company that will best serve his people; gives it to newly formed shelf company headed by his crony\n\nCrony: could actually perform the task he illicitly won and make decent honest profit doing so thus providing houses to thousands of his people; poorly builds a few houses to provide illusion of progress and steals money\n\nAdministrator: could give house to homeless or shack dwellers to best serve his people; gives houses to friends who live elsewhere making them landlords\n\n\nLandlord: Could offer affordable rent and exclusively serve the intended recipients thereby enriching his people; greedily charges exorbitant rent predominantly to foreigners.\n\nThis principle within blacks extends its way all the way to our president (the fucking madness) and the majority of all parliamentarians and civil servants.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happily.

If you wish to do business with a multinational or government entity you have to be 54% black owned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most black owned business survives on grants from the government and/or corruptly procured tenders.\nWe have a luxury department store, Luminance, and an online radio station, TouchHD, which have been funded by government&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;development&amp;quot;  money and  have run at a loss for their entire existence.\nAlso, 80% of the development money and loans made by government isn&amp;#39;t returned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The government is provably riddled with capture, corruption and cronyism yet Whites are blamed for the majority of the country&amp;#39;s problems.\nThe national airline has been bankrupt for years.\nThe power provider is expensive and often has load-shedding.\nRoads agency and postal company are utter failures.\nThe police are corrupt and bribes can be used to get out of pretty much anything (Roadblocks when drunk or speeding can cost from a can of cold drink to R1000 or whatever shopping you have in the boot. Spousal abuse charges, assault charges, burglary charges and excessive speeding charges can all be dropped for around R5000 to R25000. High profile cases like celebrity crimes, murder or rape can have dockets lost or blood work contaminated for R100k to R500k - this is fairly common knowledge and several people I know have had the charges they pressed mysteriously dropped or have paid a bribe to have charges dropped)\nPublic schools are terrible and pass rates are low despite the fact that 30% is the pass mark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but what&amp;#39;s most important to understand is the following:\nMost of the things mentioned impact blacks more than Whites.\nWhites rely on private: Security, Hospitals, Schools, Electricity and Water (in part) bc we know the gov isn&amp;#39;t there for us. But with blacks the govt &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; there for them and yet education, infrastructure and opportunity has gotten worse for them.
