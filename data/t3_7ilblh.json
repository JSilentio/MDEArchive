If you dont move them then they remain locked in your account, but if you want to buy something or transfer someone crypto, you \"move\" the bitcoin to them. The coin is then released from the address or wallet in your control to the address of the person or entity you are sending it to.  This is a transaction and inorder to verify that the bitcoin that was previously locked away in a \"block\" in the address you controlled was moved, it requires a complex cryptographic calculation, inorder to fit the bitcoin in a new \"block\" at the new address or wallet.  A wallet or public address is the where and what, it is public to the network, however the private key is what makes it so you can move a bitcoin from an address to another address.  This private key is essentially the ownership of the bitcoin(s) as having the ability to move a bitcoin on the network is what it means to own one. Making these transactions and creating the new \"blocks\" is what mining is, miners are rewarded with bitcoins for performing the calculations necessary to fit the transactions that have occured on the network and verify that they are valid, that the public and private keys used to move them are correct and that the coins exist in the address, and the destination address also exists. The only way to solve this complex cryptographic set is to try every possible combination. The difficulty required, and essentially the number of computation cycles of a processor, is determined by the number of miners or available processing power on the network, working to solve the next block.  Once solved, the \"block\" can be verified as valid by processing its hash, this is a one way mathematical test, in that it requires very little processing power to check that the math is right, but only after all the other math was done to solve for it.  This proof of work process, provides objective, mathematically/cryptographically verified evidence that the processing power has been expended and the \"block\" has been solved or \"mined\".  Once the \"block\" is mined, the miner is the one that determines where the new bitcoins that have been released get to go.  This is what  gives bitcoin inherent value as it is immutable. Controlling a bitcoin means controlling the most powerful distributed network computer, for defineable about of time and energy.

There is no set supply, and it is constantly increasing, a dollar today is worth more than what a dollar will be in 1 year or two years or 10 years. The supply increases and its value decreases.

You can send and recieve your coins, and they will remain untainted by the scruples of hebes and kikes with their off-chain channels.  I see no issue in encorporating ease of use trust based layers to btc, it is called layer 2 because it is an addition to BTC not an alteration, hence no need for a hard fork, lightning networks will be responsible for themselves, and will have no effect on the blockchain aside from the regular tx they produce when they close. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you cant just keep making the block bigger, to scale btc that way would lead to multi gig blocks FAST. we are at less than 1% adoption in the US, and there are issues and thats with a majority of new people keeping coins on exchanges where they dont even make tx to clog the mempool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/7ilblh/sell_high_buy_low/dr0kk9i/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dr0kk9i", "created": 1512890465.0, "author_flair_text": "ima BRRAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPpPp!!!
