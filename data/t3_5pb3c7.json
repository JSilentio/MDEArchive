My dad was well aware of this and told me he&amp;#39;d buy it, but he told me there was a catch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he was to buy my young heart&amp;#39;s only desire, the Xbox, we would have to use it to &amp;quot;bond&amp;quot;, he told me.

My father is a rotund man with a harsh, tan, Greek face. At the time he was just turning 40, but he&amp;#39;d never really celebrated a Christmas before, and no one ever thought to buy him any gifts. I know, it&amp;#39;s sad, but as the provider for his household his entire life there wasn&amp;#39;t much I could give him except whatever form of compassion he would take from me.

I was usually lucky if I got some batteries for my old game boy color, but then they&amp;#39;d just run out within the week and I&amp;#39;d be left to pretend to play it until next Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year was a little bit different because my mother and father separated, and I moved out of a house and into a cheap apartment with my father. So my father was able to save enough money for the whole &amp;quot;shebang&amp;quot; he said - he really liked that word. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time Christmas Day was inching near I was giddy with excitement, and my father started to become more jovial than normal as well. My father is very hard to talk to, very stone faced, very reserved. I&amp;#39;d never seen him act so gleeful before that Christmas week, and it was almost as if he was regressing in some strange way. His tan harsh face was stretched in a constant smile, and when he relaxed his face it looked like a broken in catcher&amp;#39;s mitt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kept calling me weird juvenile names (albeit in a completely joking manner) like doofus, butt head, fart licker, cheese sniffer, paint eater, water head, four eyes, train tracks, faggot, sock sucker, and other ones I can&amp;#39;t recall. And as Christmas approached the names only got more juvenile: doodybutt, poopyhead, dumperdink, weenylicker, fartface. The night before Christmas his whole demeanor seemed to shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go sleepy doodybreath&amp;quot; was the only thing he said to me the entire Christmas Eve day. Anytime I tried to make conversation he would just shake his head, look at the ground, stick is lower lip out like he was sad, and say &amp;quot;go sleepy. I went to bed early that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I awoke it was Christmas Day, and boy was I ready to go off-roading in the Brazilian mountains, triple backflipping with my very own virtual ATV. But when I got to my Christmas tree I noticed the packaging strewn all over the floor, everywhere, like some rabid animal had gotten to it. As I approached the main living room I could hear the faint hissing of our 32&amp;quot; classic tube TV, with music coming from it as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then saw what looked to be a giant toddler sitting on the living room floor, wearing a race car onesy, hypnotized by the TV and twiddling his toes underneath the onesy in a frenzy as he performed triple-backflips in the jungle mountains of Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without taking his eyes off the screen he said &amp;quot;hey papa can you make me hot-cokey?&amp;quot;. His thumbs continued to fiddle with the controller, and I saw him do a quadruple spinning backflip on screen, scoring massive points. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly walked over to whoever it was, stood between him and the TV and looked down at him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was my father, the tan Greek man, wearing the race car onesie, with his chest hair poking out of the top just above the zipper. I could see his golden cross necklace poking out a little bit and shining a shimmering light. His face was completely the same but completely different, if that makes any sense - his aura had changed. His eyes were brighter than I&amp;#39;d ever seen them before, he had always looked so depressed before, so dead in the face - not anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Papa you&amp;#39;re in the way!&amp;quot; He yelled at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I got a sinking feeling in my chest, the same one I felt that time I got stung by a bee playing soccer and went into anaphylactic shock, where a sense of overcast doom moves in like some wicked weather system - something was seriously wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a beeline for the only door to the apartment but I was quickly grabbed by my father. He gave me a big bear hug and turned me away from the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I love you so much papa&amp;quot; he said as he swung me around, squeezing the life out of me. &amp;quot;Now make me some hot-cokey!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He let me go and I stood completely motionless in disbelief at my situation. The child-like quality in my father&amp;#39;s face then left for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hot-cokey.&amp;quot; He said sternly, and resumed playing his game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mustered up the strength to say something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dad&amp;quot; I said with a shaking, teary voice &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re scaring me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t turn around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dad, there&amp;#39;s something wrong with you and you&amp;#39;re scaring me.&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he turned around slowly, his head was shaking. He looked at me with pain in his face, tears streaming from his eyes and sweat from his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please l-leave.&amp;quot; He said, straining his voice. I stood there watching him, unable to follow as I was in shock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Son! Please leave!&amp;quot; He yelped, voice cracking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that final command I left, went to my mom&amp;#39;s house, and I haven&amp;#39;t seen him since. We&amp;#39;ve tried to contact him in multiple ways. When we send emails we get weird rambling replies back.
