Social liberalism *tends* to champion inclusion of cultural influences, social conservatism *tends* to preserve and repeat.

I think we're just disagreeing over the labels maybe? \n\nSome bullshit that isn't as relevant, but I had to write it: the question isn't whether Dali was or was not fascist, the question is, did he ever come close to proving fascist alignment in any remotely tangible way? You sound like you're quite educated about the arts, so I'm sure you heard of a little thing called Dada... could that have anything to do with Dali talking out of his ass about politics for the sake of absurdity? Why was he fleeing actual fascists in WW2 by acquiring a visa to desperately shoehorn himself into America? Hugo Boss would be a better example of a creative with fascist sensibilities lol.  Should I dismiss Bowie's entire lifestyle as being a false front of being an open-minded guy because he gave a ~~roman salute~~ nazi salute after most likely 20 days of doing freudian levels of coke? Bruh, these maniacs are as *socially* liberal as they come. \n\nthat being said, I'm **not saying** anything here is definitive or that there aren't going to be exceptions with creativity and political tendencies...
