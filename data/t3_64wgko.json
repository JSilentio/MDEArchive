claiming that he had his \"labia area\" examined, and then declaring that it was all a ruse. Of course, these were proven to be blatant lies. Chris had edited the message about the exam, changing his story as he went on. If that wasn't telling enough, a second picture provided by insider trolls displayed the wound from another angle, making it extremely unlikely to be a Photoshop hoax.\n\n&gt;Unlike the first picture, in which the \"labia\" was posed for his fanbase on Facebook, the second exhibited how badly Chris was handling what could have evolved into a life-threatening problem. He is shown spreading the wound as if it were a vagina.\n\n&gt;Originally, it was thought that Chris's migrated skin from the Un-clit had opened into a wound, forming an abscess. The wound itself appeared to have demonstrated proud flesh, an overgrowth of granulated tissue.\n\n&gt;However, the truth was far worse, as it was eventually discovered that **Chris had actually sliced himself open with a knife in order to free the vagina he thought was growing within him.**\n\n&gt;It posed serious health risks to Chris since it could have become gangrenous and caused septic shock if the infection had reached his bloodstream and nearby abdominal organs.
