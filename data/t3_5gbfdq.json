There are indeed \"reasons/explanations\" as to why the construct was created, but it most likely wasnt because people all of a sudden realized that there was an objective magic number written in the laws of nature, and that orgasms below that number caused objective and definable harm. It is the result of a k-selection type species ever leaning k. This is why they didnt go from \"no law\" to \"must be \"18\", but rather increased slowly from non-existence to where it is now, in small increments. \n\n&gt; You're walking a fine line on that one, and like I said, I'm still not convinced that what may resemble widespread pedophillia in past era's is indeed the same exact psychological phenomenon we can observe today.

There is no reason to believe that at least some of them are the person that married a 13 year old in the past, but now they are in a world where it is illegal. It is similar to polygamy. Very few people today are polygamist despite the fact that nobody would argue against the fact that polygyny was the norm for hundreds of thousands of years, and all of recorded history. Despite that, many people have no interest in polygamy, and even when they do, can restrain themselves given that they live in an environment that disincentives it. There is no way to measure how much of the modern example would resemble the typical historical type, if it were not banned.

It makes more sense that the psychological harm stems from the fact that our society considers them as good as dead, or better off dead. When people say that getting molested is  worse than being killed, they are saying that they are better off dead. I cannot think of any other explanation for why only societies that have had the concept (recent western civilization) result in psychological trauma (obviously not counting \"at knife point\" kidnap/force related). When people argue that pedophiles should be murdered, they are signaling that the harm done to the children is equivalent (at least) to have been murdered. They argue that their lives are over, wont ever be the same, wont ever be normal etc. There are even people that say they rather have their lost child be found dead than molested.
