I always tell them it's because girls never give attention to guys unless they're 9/10 or above, or have something really good going for them, or the girl is ugly in the first place. You basically have to prove your worth to any woman above a 5/10 (I don't know if it was always like that or not). This wouldn't really be an issue but fathers are not telling their kids how to best go about approaching and creating relationships with women. Many fathers are not teaching their kids how to do anything, actually. Many people don't have strong father figures. When you're taught mostly by your mother I think you might become scared of what women might think of you, so you just never approach them or try. \n\nVideogames are also an easy escape for the socially inadequate, and Elliot was addicted to WoW from the comments I've read. It's too easy to isolate yourself now. When you're a young male none of your peers even invite you to do anything, cause they don't do anything themselves, they just play video games. If you want to do something you have to be proactive and actually plan it out yourself, make sure your friends don't flake to play CS GO, and then when you do go out with your friends there's no one else your age doing anything, it's all just old people or young kids, no one to mingle with. This might not be the case in California but it certainly is in the midwest. The only people my age who actually do anything are the druggie kids, and they just do drugs and throw rocks at suburban homes, I've hung out with them before and it wasn't very fun and there was a lot of drama with the druggie girls. \n\nI've been to about 3 different comedy clubs on multiple nights and I've never seen someone like me, no one younger than around 24 or so. It's basically the same with music venues as well. Everyone is 25-50, and though they're easy to talk to, you're not really going to develop actually relationships with people so much older than you unless those people are a bit off. I know some of the local comics and stuff but that's about it.\n\nEveryone is so isolated and alienated cause there are so many easy escapes to boredom. When I was a kid and the internet was only JUST starting to infect everyone on a massive scale, when I was bored I would go find the kids in the other neighborhoods and ride bikes with them throughout town or in the open sewer system lol. In modern day those kids are killing zombies on their xbox ones and having a perfectly good time doing so, with friends as well. All socializing is done digitally now, especially with the opposite sex. It's no wonder people are socially awkward. Even people that don't look socially awkward are fucking retards socially. \n\nIf you don't have a snapchat, instagram, or a facebook, you're well out of the game, sorry, you got almost no chance with developing any relationships with your peers, or girls. It's actually weird to ask girls for their numbers now, you're supposed to get their snapchats first. I asked a girl for her number and she gave me her snapchat instead, but I'm not going to download an app and make ad revenue so I can maybe have a chance with a girl. I don't care enough, and neither do the hundreds of thousands of other sub 8/10 guys my age.\n\nBut there's also a pandemic of extremely attractive guys dating massive slobs of women, and I don't understand it at all. The super attractive girls at my school date military guys, while the pretty attractive ones date college students, and the average girls date the attractive guys. Online dating I think is to blame for that one. Any girl can find a dick within a 10 mile radius with a click of a button, doesn't matter if they're from your local community or not. Girls are dating outside their communities so a lot of guys are being left in the dust. \n\nWhatever though man, who gives a shit? At the end of the day I know I'm a hyper-ultra God, so much so that WOMEN AREN'T WORTHY OF ME. I'd rather bend my dick into my own ass than have a girl for a while until she decides it's another guy's turn. Heartbreak for no reason other than biological desire. Men are the romantics, and romance is basically what guys do for women. There's massive inequality in this regard. \n\nAlso the recent global infatuation with traps is a direct result of the inequalities between the sexes. Mark my words, it's only going to get worse until we're forced to return to some form of traditionalism.\n\nI think it's all kind of hilarious in a sad way. If you reach back you can pinpoint the moments that people knew something like this was coming.
