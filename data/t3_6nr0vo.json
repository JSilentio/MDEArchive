It takes place at a dinner party (rather than at a club? in the movie) hosted by his fiance, Evelyn.  They're accompanied by Stash, an artist, and Vanden, his girlfriend, Courtney and Timothy.  It doesn't really matter who the last two are.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Death of Downtown,\u201d he says; then, pointing at each word in the headline, \u201cWho-gives-a-rat\u2019s-ass?\u201d\n\n&gt;I automatically expect Stash to look up from his plate but he still stares at the lone piece of sushi, smiling to himself and nodding.\n\n&gt;\u201cHey,\u201d Vanden says, as if she was insulted. \u201cThat affects us.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cOh ho ho,\u201d Tim says warningly. \u201cThat affects us? What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn\u2019t that affect us too? What about Sri Lanka?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cWell, that\u2019s a cool club in the Village.\u201d Vanden shrugs. \u201cYeah, that affects us too.\u201d\n\n&gt;Suddenly Stash speaks without looking up. \u201cThat\u2019s called The Tonka.\u201d He sounds pissed but his voice is even and low, his eyes still on the sushi. \u201cIt\u2019s called The Tonka, not Sri Lanka. Got it? The Tonka.\u201d\n\n&gt;Vanden looks down, then meekly says, \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cI mean don\u2019t you know anything about Sri Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of Israelis there?\u201d Timothy goads her. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that affect us?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cKappamaki roll anyone?\u201d Evelyn cuts in cheerfully, holding up a plate.\n\n&gt;\u201cOh come on, Price,\u201d I say. \u201cThere are more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cLike what?\u201d he asks without looking away from Vanden. \u201cBy the way, why is there an ice cube in my soy sauce?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cNo,\u201d I start, hesitantly. \u201cWell, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger.
