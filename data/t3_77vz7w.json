These teachings are likely to be ignored, especially because parents of these kids do not reinforce those valued and neither do their peers. Remember, responsible and studious black kids are \"acting white\".

Maybe I am naive but I think it can certainly be done to a degree (I am not talking about an increase in IQ).  \n\n&gt; Its a big factor and frankly very important. Genitics also has behavioral components which is another problem to add. If behavior is genetic then we need to tackle this as well. Delaying gratification for example is a mostly white and asian behavior that is far less expressed by blacks and hispanics. This is quite crucial as delaying gratification leads to a higher quality of life.\n\nIf you can explain to me why delayed gratification cannot be taught or instilled through emphasis then I have to say that my position will probably become substantially less optimistic.

If you're more likely to see violence in low iq people then supporting keeping low iq minorities means you're supporting the rise in violence and criminality that they will bring as a result of their low IQ. There are also many industrious idiots that arent successful so i dont get what the point of this is.

I agree with you on the severity of the issue in those countries of course and I didn&amp;#39;t think it through when I wrote &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know how bad it is in other countries&amp;quot; ... yeah I know it is fucking bad.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways,   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look at all black classrooms, not much teaching gets done.

Blacks have a crabs in a bucket mentality unfortunately and that holds many of them back from escaping welfare and ghetto lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where I think there is gray room.  Are those black kids who are studious just &amp;quot;acting white&amp;quot; or are they being raised by good parents who show them the value of education?  You seem to be arguing entirely on the side of biology, when what I am saying is that culture also plays a huge role (although culture obviously grows from biology).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You seem to believe that the crabs in a bucket mentality cannot be augmented, but I believe that it can.

This is quite crucial as delaying gratification leads to a higher quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can explain to me why delayed gratification cannot be taught or instilled through emphasis then I have to say that my position will probably become substantially less optimistic. If you can point me towards a source that would be great, but I am also going to do this research on my own because it&amp;#39;s obviously of extreme importance.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to say that I think the ability to delay gratification lies on a spectrum.  Some people have stronger capacity to project the future than others.  What I think can improve this situation for people who have less capacity to project is for them to have a much stronger, positive, and desirable vision of the future than what is currently the carrot on a stick.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By admission thats a negative.
