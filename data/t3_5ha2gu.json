I continued following him from the early youtube videos (Dracula Rap, Gra-go-tion, World&amp;#39;s Most Comfortable Man), through the vertical videos and now to this most recent developments on Adult Swim.

At this point, its hard to see the cancellation as anything but inevitable. Sam relied on his fanbase being an independent creator, and courting a fanbase mostly through social media that also has a propensity to lash out and who attempt to squash any hint of sincerity is a recipe for blowing up in your face. Being reactionary online by design gets more hits, and if you rely on this fanbase to support your work and pay your rent, being more reactionary guarantees more hits and more amplification; until it doesnt. An audience that will turn on you if you dont tow the party line simply just isnt going to be tolerated in a professional setting, and hinting at beliefs in racial and gender-based hierarchy is just not going to fly at any place of business.

The pizzagate obsession only drove this point home further. Sam doesnt care about pedophilia or missing children, he just wanted to play an alternate reality game in an attempt to get moral high ground over &amp;quot;liberals&amp;quot; and as a way of dissmissing the actual sexual assault allegations of pussygate. If Sam gave a shit about missing children, maybe he would actually donate or volunteer or actually help with the campaign surrounding a legitimately missing or kidnapped kid. But that would require actual sincerity or caring about someone other than yourself.

His criticisms of Gelman were that his comedy was &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uncomfortable&amp;quot;. Isnt that what MDE is in part about? Isnt that what any good boundary pushing or experimental comedy should be? I always liked when MDE made me uncomfortable and evaluate my position on things, but if you&amp;#39;re just waging a war of ideology that nukes your options for career support in the future, youre not even an artist anymore, youre just a demagogue and a radical. Once youve lost any room for interpretation or nuance, youre not even working in the long tradition of irony or comedy any more; its pure cynicism that sees any sort of compromising as an attack on your authenticity. The show kind of had to blow up for this reason, as any sort of diminishment of Sam&amp;#39;s outsider/anarchic personality would be seen as a diminishment to his entire image of self after tying himself to the preservation and fortifying of a white/masculine identity and the demands of your audience.
