I still feel major guilt about even believing for a second my 650 square foot home was anything close to humble so I also removed the decorative flooring.

But this is just part and parcel of my new life, and it&amp;#39;s part and parcel of the hazard refugees face when using open flame cooking devices in refugee centers and apartment buildings, I am in the same constant danger of a small mistake taking my life in a blaze of fire as they are.  One day I hope to give up my decadent 650 square foot home to a refugee family, it&amp;#39;s the least I could do.
