Even though most Americans no longer had access to clean drinking water, and most food was provided by a fast food monopoly (formed when slavery reparations were paid in full, and popeyes chicken was able to buyout mcdonalds), Bryce thought in his little slave head that things were good, and that this war, being fought in Iran, was totally justified even though it caused untold suffering for everyone involved and the army was putting supplements that forced him to stay awake for 48 hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bryce switched on his Microsoft headset. \u201cNiner-niner, tango foxtrot delta- they\u2019re dead, I repeat, they\u2019re dead\u201d.
