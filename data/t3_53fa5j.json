I always try my best to not be a douche provided somebody doesn&amp;#39;t call me a fucking faggot over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand why a father would leave his kid and GF but i think in the vast majority of cases the dad leaving causes more harm than good, and I think it&amp;#39;s a bad thing to do to someone, in the vast majority of cases missing a parent really fucks people up. three of my best friends in middle school and highschool didn&amp;#39;t have father figures and one of them ended up getting addicted to meth and the other one ended up staying with an insane bipolar GF who hates me for some reason and doesn&amp;#39;t like it when he hangs out with his friends, and he&amp;#39;s deals with it because he&amp;#39;s a total pussy and a yes man in every way. the other guy dropped out but went to a government program for job training and ended up becoming a mechanic so he&amp;#39;s doing okay, but he smokes a ton of pot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like your dad leaving you changed you for the better or did it mess you up more than anything? a little bit of both maybe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true,
