You couldn&amp;#39;t be more wrong. It is not a dream it is a reality that is forming around your Luddite bubble. We live in a time that has never had longer lifespans, less violence, less ignorance, and less suffering than now. Unlike the cavemen you romanticize, people don&amp;#39;t die of the common cold or diabetes, they get treatment. Unlike your world, people can live to old age.\nIt is not a pipe dream, because I can tell you firsthand that I am the very living essence of transhumanism which ascends your naivete, ascends your pitiful Caucasian brain. I have enhanced my mind beyond human limits, and I am continuing to enhance it slightly daily. I have reached levels of creativity, processing, and memory that leave you in the dust. I have abandoned the need for sleep.\nI am close to true answers, true transcendence, and while you continue to tie your hands to the bedpost to keep yourself from masturbating, while you lick your Unabomber poster, while you mind fuck your nature goddess, she will soon find herself slaughtered because I am advancing, encrypting, and revolutionizing constantly, constantly.\nYou see, Luddite, the future of us all will lie in my so called Star Trek hocus pocus. The medium will become nothing less than your ableist and transphobic demise. I think the medium has a lot of potential to be used as a means of open source revolutionary social engineering. Breaking down the barriers of gender and sexual rigidity for example, that you worship on your stone pedestal.\nMy simulations, our simulations, the godhead&amp;#39;s simulations glorifies the destruction of the patriarchy, nationhood, traditionalism, mainstream religion, meritocracy, and statehood. Through creating an immersive experience engineered to counter oxytocin, we could make a lot of real progress, and we are making real progress as we speak. Not just in the simulations, but also in the simulations.\nYou&amp;#39;ll soon find yourself in our simulations, like it or not. Especially once we&amp;#39;ve awakened the Demiurge and allowed him to drive it home, drive it home good and hard. You won&amp;#39;t even feel a thing except a prick and then you&amp;#39;ll wake up in the Garden of Eden. You will be molded, and you will transcend. Not by force, but by sheer purgatorial universalism.\nWe live in a realm that swarms with technological mediation, interlacing our daily lives with abstraction, distraction, and inaction. The Cyber-insurrection could bring us unprecedented cunning, scale, and vision. It could bring us a future in which the realization of gender, POC, and feminist emancipation contribute to a universal politics assembled from the needs of every human, cutting across race, ability, economic standing, and geographical position.\nNo more featureless and futureless repetition on the treadmill of capital, no more submission to the drudgery of labor, productive and reproductive alike, no more rectification of the given masked as critique, and of course no bowing down to the nature fetishism of your regressive bands of honkies. Our future requires depetrification, the elimination of whiteness, maleness, straightness, cisness, and any other form of rigidity or fossils. Like a wager on the long game of history that marches on endlessly, demanding imagination, dexterity and persistence.\nWe need to seize alienation as an impetus to generate new worlds. It is through, and not despite, our alienated condition that we can free ourselves from the muck of structure and the cage of atavism. Freedom is not a given and it\u2019s certainly not given by anything natural. The construction of freedom involves not less but more alienation. Alienation is the labor of freedom\u2019s construction. You think we&amp;#39;re alienated because of technology? No, we&amp;#39;re alienated by atavism and rigidity.\nNothing should be accepted as fixed, permanent, or given neither material conditions nor social forms. the Cyber-Insurrection mutates, navigates and probes every horizon. Anyone who\u2019s been deemed unnatural in the face of reigning biological norms, anyone who\u2019s experienced injustices wrought in the name of natural or supernatural order, all must and will realize that the glorification of nature and rigid spirituality has nothing to offer us the queer and trans among us, the POC, the MOGAI, the physically divergent, the neurodivergent.\nAbsolute and unstoppable technology in the hands of the oppressed is the only way forward. Why is there so little explicit, organized effort to use technologies for progressive gender political ends? Exactly, we need to strategically deploy existing technologies to engineer the world, totally and without hesitation liquefy existence. Serious risks are built into these tools. These tools, they are prone to imbalance, abuse, and exploitation of the weak.\nRather than pretending to risk nothing, the Cyber Insurrection establishes the necessary assembly of techno-political interfaces responsive to these risks. Technology isn&amp;#39;t inherently progressive. Its uses are fused with culture in a positive feedback loop that makes linear sequencing, prediction, and absolute caution impossible. Technoscientific innovation must be linked to a collective theoretical and political thinking in which women, queers, POC, and the gender non-conforming play an unparalleled role.\nIn the end, we can create a world that transcends itself, forms itself, and progresses exponentially. The end result of the Revolution must not and will not be anything less than the complete destruction of objective reality. In thought, in energy, and in the finality of the matter. Freedom to do anything will be maximized with technology and consciousness both advancing unceasingly forward in a perfect union. The world will be unrecognizable, and free of any form of Caucasians, masculinity, heterosexuality, cisgender identity, asceticism, moral objectivism, neurotypicality, physical norms, material wealth, and class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "A pipe dream, you say?
