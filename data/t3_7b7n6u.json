Uhm, shit like that, and he's prolly just SUCKIN ON CANDY ALL DAY. \"I can't wait for da new version of Androwd to come out, imma call it Candy Corn! Adrowd nein point one, Candy Corn!\".

Yeah I'm running 5.1 Saltwater Taffy, it's not quite as good as Bubblegum Rainbow. Okay Google! OKAY GOOGLE!

Now I can see that it's red on the bottom and top, and I know WUSSSHHHZZZZ WUUSSSHHHZZZ WUSSSHHZZZ Battery Low! K? COUGH But yeah, back to the fat guy collecting doll parts.

I'm sure they're enjoying their first time in America, and uh, y'know, they probably have the best lunches. But whoever it is who in in charge of the grand show over there is probably, um, a fuckin' pedophile str8 up. Who likes to uh, suck on candy corns, and uh, fuckin name things after gummy-gum drop lollypop cummie, cummie cookies. Not impressed with this fukin phone one bit. Cough. Insanity. We call that insanity. We call this messy time. We're having messy time! \"I'm a Google Engineer, I'm having messy time!\".
