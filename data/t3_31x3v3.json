Or were perhaps things of a darker nature at play?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Let me tell ya something slick, you ain&amp;#39;t been where I&amp;#39;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Where you been man?

I&amp;#39;ve watched you warp the minds of men and all this time I&amp;#39;ve been resolute.

You see how the handcuffs workin&amp;#39; there around your dick and your balls, huh? You see how the jig works when it&amp;#39;s in your nozz, huh? See how your ears work when you got a q-tip in your mouth, huh nigga?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -I just wanna, I gotta know what the plan is for this guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -The plan is whatever he says from the word &amp;#39;go&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Hehe, you got the word go man.

But I&amp;#39;m not gonna say it. What do you think he knows about- Or how he knows-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -I HAVE NO IDEA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRRUMATIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: I immediately knew that the professor&amp;#39;s attempts to rehabilitate or understand Manslave were a cleverly rehearsed charade. What I did not know at the time was that Professor Badtanman was playing a high stakes game of cat and mouse. A game he could not afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Sooo, Doctor Manslave, huh?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -For the benifit of our new friend, Mr. Goldman here, I&amp;#39;d like to go through one of our word associations that you seem so fond of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EVERYONE: -Alright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Ah yes, the tablet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -The exercise hasn&amp;#39;t worn thin on you yet, has it sir?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Nay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Simple word association. Typical of your, you know, psychiatric evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Nothing fancy going on here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Alright Manslave. Storytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Can&amp;#39;t you go and get me a Rorschach?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -A Rorschach?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Get me a written Rorschach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Are you a, are you a uh, are you a psychiatrist?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -I may have dabbled in the arts before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -What do you think about Carl Jung?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Sure, there is a lot you can deduce about a person based on their uh, sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Do you believe in the collective unconscious?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -I hear the call, I answer it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Do you answer the call for food?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -What do you do when he beckons you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -I go towards the blackness. I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Do you recall what you did with JJ, upstairs after the prom? I do, I know you recall it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Storytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Finish the story with JJ. I don&amp;#39;t want to expose you before you even have a chance to defend yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Badtanman coughs violently&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-IF YOU&amp;#39;RE GONNA KEEP PUFFIN&amp;#39;, WHY DON&amp;#39;T YOU JUST PUKE?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Alright, Manslave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Fine, Mr. Captain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Storytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -It was a sunny day. It must&amp;#39;ve been about...68 degreeees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Manslave please, we have to go through these quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Heh, storytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Storytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -See what I&amp;#39;m dealing with here, Goldman?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Yeah. Here&amp;#39;s another thing I&amp;#39;m dealing with though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Does everybody hate me here and not want me here? Am I not here to help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -October 17th.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Is there anything you want to get off your chest there, Manslave? Before we begin?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -I&amp;#39;ve been to New York and I&amp;#39;ve went to see you when you were practicing with (?) or do you forget something?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Do you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Let&amp;#39;s do the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Storytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Blueberry pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Are you really a doctor? Let&amp;#39;s assume that you are for the sake of heart. What do you make of what I said?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -When you talk about blueberry pancakes. Probably refering to...Anal pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -I&amp;#39;ve never heard those two words put togeter in a sentence in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Why do you like it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -It&amp;#39;s not the fact that I like it, it&amp;#39;s the fact that I need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -October 17th. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Alright, we&amp;#39;ll just write &amp;#39;child rape&amp;#39; there. A typical answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -I didn&amp;#39;t say child rape, I said blueberry pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -We&amp;#39;ll talk about your typical answer there, child rape. That&amp;#39;s usually what you answer there, almost any word is child rape. Very creative. October 17th.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARIA IV: THE SELF-FLAGELLATING PENISES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Ne cede malis.&amp;quot; -T.D Williams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: Kindness was met with hostility. Hostility with glee. Every question was met with a question. Manslave would allow us to pose hypotheses, only for the pleasure of shooting them down effortlessly. I could feel myself being pulled deeper and deeper into his world. His charisma, his power. I was cold. And I knew it wouldn&amp;#39;t be long before I wore him. Like a coat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Alright, Goldman. I think we need to regroup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;lights a cigarette for Goldman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Thank you, Professor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-In all my years of dealing with this sort of thing, frankly I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I can&amp;#39;t believe he&amp;#39;s been in a facility like this for so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Or else we&amp;#39;ll take &amp;#39;im.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -That&amp;#39;s your answer for this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -What are you gonna do with him? Put him to death?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -You guys are just going to keep him here forever? That&amp;#39;s your answer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -This is the only place left on planet Earth for Manslave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -Don&amp;#39;t need this job!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -This is the only thing Cobra can do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-He&amp;#39;s immune to Manslave&amp;#39;s mocking!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -Gotta keep him there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -That&amp;#39;s fine with me, I can stay with him-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -KEEP HIM DOWN!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -I can try to work with him. Right, and I&amp;#39;ll work with him and I can-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -FIX HIM, WILL YA?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Can&amp;#39;t fix Manslave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -Couple of wrenches, you can fix anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -He&amp;#39;s got a couple screws loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -All I hear is a bolt that needs tightenin&amp;#39;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -We&amp;#39;ll use him like a trashcan for a while. I&amp;#39;m gonna work out, I&amp;#39;ll listen to his story, I&amp;#39;ll hear him out, I need to work this out and see if I can fucking mold together something that&amp;#39;s like a normal human being. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -You, the New York City lawyer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -It&amp;#39;s always about that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -He&amp;#39;s got every answer...He read every chapter, and it&amp;#39;s all in there. Isn&amp;#39;t that right, boy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -I&amp;#39;m gonna come in here and I&amp;#39;ll heal him and it works every single time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Oh yeeeah...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -How many people came through here and dealt with this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Twenty-seven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Twenty-seven?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Including yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Do you think you cou-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Shut the fuck up, Manslave! Shut the fuck up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -There&amp;#39;s nothing I have known...When I grew up, you men were still freaks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -How old is he?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -THIRTY!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Thirty years old?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -Thirty years old!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Right. Well, I&amp;#39;m sixty. So why is he telling me things that happened when I was 10 years old?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COBRA: -Cuckoo!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Oh my god.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I wanna get to know you a little bit. I&amp;#39;m here to help you, so I&amp;#39;m pretty much the only friend you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;lights cigarette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Why don&amp;#39;t you give me a little bit of that too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Here you go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-See? I&amp;#39;m here to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -I trust you now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -You trust me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Then why don&amp;#39;t you start opening up a little bit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -I can open up for ya. But you gotta tell me a few things about yourself that I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Okay, okay. I&amp;#39;m up for that, but-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Tell me about your father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -My father or my stepfather?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Tell me about your father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -I don&amp;#39;t wanna talk about my fath-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Tell me about your FATHER!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -I don&amp;#39;t wanna talk-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FATHER!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -My father didn&amp;#39;t do shit, all he did was fucking torment my life and fucking make my life a living hell when I was a kid!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Did he ever...Abuse you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Oh, shut up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Answer my question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -I don&amp;#39;t wanna answer your-This isn&amp;#39;t about me, Manslave!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Did your father beat you? Oh god. My father was a carny...On a circus, Rhode Island. 0 to 8,95 and I grew up there. He did things...Things that exist between time and space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Can you answer my one question? Why you came here? From Harvaaard. The Harvaaard and the Law Reviiiew, yes? I see by the patterns on your tie which fraternity you belong to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-You don&amp;#39;t think I wasn&amp;#39;t Skull and Bones? Heh, you fool. You still haven&amp;#39;t answered my question. You need to tell me about your father. Things that you haven&amp;#39;t told anybody, not even your diary and the moleskine. Heh. I know you write in that. I know you use your disposable Bic fountain pens and hide them in that. I know your type. Too cheap to buy a good Waterman. Hmph. Ink&amp;#39;s too thick and bleeds through the pageees...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -I&amp;#39;ll give you that, but...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Maybe your father&amp;#39;s dead, maybe he&amp;#39;s been dead for years, maybe he&amp;#39;s been d-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Or maybe-maybe he&amp;#39;s the professor?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Maybe that&amp;#39;s the case, Manslave!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Maybe he couldn&amp;#39;t make you love him no matter what he bought you. No matter what he showed you about life, about liberty and about justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -Yeah, yeah, you&amp;#39;re so smart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Yeah. You-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BADTANMAN: -That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN: -Actually yeah, you&amp;#39;re right, that&amp;#39;s it. That&amp;#39;s my father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MANSLAVE: -Listen.

You sick fuck! *gags*\n\nMANSLAVE: -If you're gonna go puke why don't you go to the men's room like a fucking kid, you (?)\n\nBADTANMAN: -I've sat through enough of your shit.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Why don't I sit on your face and I'll show you what a real man feels like?\n\nBADTANMAN: -Listen to me, Manslave. I've watched you warp the minds of men and all this time I've been resolute. I think you need to take a good, hard look in the mirror.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Does he always smoke two cigarettes like he smokes two dicks?\n\n-The both of you guys have been sticking your dick in his mouth for the last fucking 12 years.\n\nCOBRA: -That's confidential!\n\nGOLDMAN: -No, it's not confidential, I have it all here in file.\n\n-Larry, and fucking...What's your name?\n\nCOBRA: -Cobra!\n\nGOLDMAN: -Cobra? Whatever it is.\n\nCOBRA: -Dave Cobra!\n\nGOLDMAN: -Keep that thing on.\n\n-Bottom line is he's here and...\n\nCOBRA: -I was born to be a cop!\n\n-Dave Cobra! You can read about me in your file.\n\n-Pussycreaaaam.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Keep it professional. Don't let him do this to ya.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Heh, you guys were munching on eachother in high school or atleast (?), you and the big bully cop man!\n\n-You must have some sort of Napoleon complex there with your fucking big, swinging dick. You can probably even feel it big and swinging, huh?\n\n-Holding that pike hanging out like a fucking puppet, I'll put your arm up your ass, and I'll work you like a puppet.\n\nCOBRA: *crying*\n\nMANSLAVE: -Yeah, you see? You see how the handcuffs workin' there around your dick and your balls, huh? You see how the jig works when it's in your nozz, huh? See how your ears work when you got a q-tip in your mouth, huh nigga?\n\nGOLDMAN: -I just wanna, I gotta know what the plan is for this guy.\n\nBADTANMAN: -The plan is whatever he says from the word 'go'.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Hehe, you got the word go man. One-two-three Mario Kart GO, huh? Mario Stadium, you hit the fucking turnpike, you fly all the way, there's no way you can get back if you use the fucking shrinky thing when they're over the jump. You can't get back after that! There's no fucking way in 64, you got four controllers, it doesn't matter if you got four fingers in your ass, it doesn't matter motherfucker, you lose. You're goooone.\n\nCOBRA: -I feel stupid. I feel real stupid.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Don't feel stupid, the thing is this guy gets in your head, this is how he works. \n\nCOBRA: -He's been doing the tap dance.\n\nGOLDMAN: -For a long time.\n\nCOBRA: -He's been doing the sloooow, strolling silver tap dance.\n\nBADTANMAN: -You know what I know about this clown right here?\n\nMANSLAVE: -Whaddaya know?\n\nBADTANMAN: -You know what I know about this little man?!\n\nMANSLAVE: -Whaddya know, Doctor Badtanman?\n\nBADTANMAN: -You want me to tell you what I know about you?\n\nMANSLAVE: -Tell me what you know if you think you're so smart you can get to me, tell me right now.\n\n-Why don't you tell me, you faggot?\n\nBADTANMAN: -You know what I know about you, Manslave?\n\nMANSLAVE: -What do you know about me?\n\nBADTANMAN: -You know what I know about this guy, Goldman?\n\nGOLDMAN: -I think I do know what you know about him. But I'm not gonna say it. What do you think he knows about- Or how he knows-\n\nCOBRA: -I HAVE NO IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n **IRRUMATIO**\n\n---------------------------------\n\nGOLDMAN: I immediately knew that the professor's attempts to rehabilitate or understand Manslave were a cleverly rehearsed charade. What I did not know at the time was that Professor Badtanman was playing a high stakes game of cat and mouse. A game he could not afford to lose.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Sooo, Doctor Manslave, huh?\n\nGOLDMAN: -Yes.\n\nBADTANMAN: -For the benifit of our new friend, Mr. Goldman here, I'd like to go through one of our word associations that you seem so fond of.\n\nEVERYONE: -Alright.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Ah yes, the tablet.\n\nBADTANMAN: -The exercise hasn't worn thin on you yet, has it sir?\n\nMANSLAVE: -Nay.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Simple word association. Typical of your, you know, psychiatric evaluations.\n\n-Nothing fancy going on here.\n\n-Alright Manslave. Storytime.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Can't you go and get me a Rorschach?\n\nBADTANMAN: -A Rorschach?\n\nMANSLAVE: -Get me a written Rorschach.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Are you a, are you a uh, are you a psychiatrist?\n\nMANSLAVE: -I may have dabbled in the arts before.\n\nBADTANMAN: -What do you think about Carl Jung?\n\n-Sure, there is a lot you can deduce about a person based on their uh, sex.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Do you believe in the collective unconscious?\n\nBADTANMAN: -I hear the call, I answer it.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Do you answer the call for food?\n\nBADTANMAN: -Yes.\n\nMANSLAVE: -What do you do when he beckons you?\n\nBADTANMAN: -I go towards the blackness. I recall.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Do you recall what you did with JJ, upstairs after the prom? I do, I know you recall it too.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Storytime.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Finish the story with JJ. I don't want to expose you before you even have a chance to defend yourself.\n\n*Badtanman coughs violently*\n\n-IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP PUFFIN', WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUKE?\n\nBADTANMAN: -Alright, Manslave.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Fine, Mr. Captain.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Storytime.\n\nMANSLAVE: -It was a sunny day. It must've been about...68 degreeees.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Manslave please, we have to go through these quickly.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Heh, storytime.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Storytime.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Okay.\n\nBADTANMAN: -See what I'm dealing with here, Goldman?\n\nGOLDMAN: -Yeah. Here's another thing I'm dealing with though.\n\n-Does everybody hate me here and not want me here? Am I not here to help?\n\nBADTANMAN: -October 17th.\n\n-Is there anything you want to get off your chest there, Manslave? Before we begin?\n\nMANSLAVE: -I've been to New York and I've went to see you when you were practicing with (?) or do you forget something?\n\n-Do you?\n\nBADTANMAN: -Let's do the exercise.\n\n-Storytime.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Blueberry pancakes.\n\n-Are you really a doctor? Let's assume that you are for the sake of heart. What do you make of what I said?\n\nBADTANMAN: -When you talk about blueberry pancakes. Probably refering to...Anal pancakes.\n\nMANSLAVE: -I've never heard those two words put togeter in a sentence in my life.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Why do you like it?\n\nMANSLAVE: -It's not the fact that I like it, it's the fact that I need it.\n\nBADTANMAN: -October 17th. \n\n-Alright, we'll just write 'child rape' there. A typical answer.\n\nMANSLAVE: -I didn't say child rape, I said blueberry pancakes.\n\nBADTANMAN: -We'll talk about your typical answer there, child rape. That's usually what you answer there, almost any word is child rape. Very creative. October 17th.\n\n\n**ARIA IV: THE SELF-FLAGELLATING PENISES**\n\n*\"Ne cede malis.\" -T.D Williams*\n\n---------------------------------\n\nGOLDMAN: Kindness was met with hostility. Hostility with glee. Every question was met with a question. Manslave would allow us to pose hypotheses, only for the pleasure of shooting them down effortlessly. I could feel myself being pulled deeper and deeper into his world. His charisma, his power. I was cold. And I knew it wouldn't be long before I wore him. Like a coat.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Alright, Goldman. I think we need to regroup.\n\n*lights a cigarette for Goldman*\n\nGOLDMAN: -Thank you, Professor.\n\n-In all my years of dealing with this sort of thing, frankly I don't know what to do. I can't believe he's been in a facility like this for so long.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Or else we'll take 'im.\n\nGOLDMAN: -That's your answer for this?\n\nBADTANMAN: -What are you gonna do with him? Put him to death?\n\nGOLDMAN: -You guys are just going to keep him here forever? That's your answer?\n\nBADTANMAN: -This is the only place left on planet Earth for Manslave.\n\nCOBRA: -Don't need this job!\n\nBADTANMAN: -This is the only thing Cobra can do!\n\n-He's immune to Manslave's mocking!\n\nCOBRA: -Gotta keep him there!\n\nGOLDMAN: -That's fine with me, I can stay with him-\n\nCOBRA: -KEEP HIM DOWN!\n\nGOLDMAN: -I can try to work with him. Right, and I'll work with him and I can-\n\nCOBRA: -FIX HIM, WILL YA?\n\nBADTANMAN: -Can't fix Manslave.\n\nCOBRA: -Couple of wrenches, you can fix anything.\n\nGOLDMAN: -He's got a couple screws loose.\n\nCOBRA: -All I hear is a bolt that needs tightenin'!\n\nGOLDMAN: -We'll use him like a trashcan for a while. I'm gonna work out, I'll listen to his story, I'll hear him out, I need to work this out and see if I can fucking mold together something that's like a normal human being. \n\nBADTANMAN: -You, the New York City lawyer?\n\nGOLDMAN: -It's always about that!\n\nBADTANMAN: -He's got every answer...He read every chapter, and it's all in there. Isn't that right, boy?\n\nGOLDMAN: -I'm gonna come in here and I'll heal him and it works every single time.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Oh yeeeah...\n\nGOLDMAN: -How many people came through here and dealt with this?\n\nBADTANMAN: -Twenty-seven.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Twenty-seven?\n\nBADTANMAN: -Including yourself.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Do you think you cou-\n\nBADTANMAN: -Shut the fuck up, Manslave! Shut the fuck up!\n\nMANSLAVE: -There's nothing I have known...When I grew up, you men were still freaks!\n\nGOLDMAN: -How old is he?\n\nCOBRA: -THIRTY!\n\nGOLDMAN: -Thirty years old?\n\nCOBRA: -Thirty years old!\n\nGOLDMAN: -Right. Well, I'm sixty. So why is he telling me things that happened when I was 10 years old?\n\nCOBRA: -Cuckoo!\n\nGOLDMAN: -Oh my god.\n\n-I wanna get to know you a little bit. I'm here to help you, so I'm pretty much the only friend you have.\n\n*lights cigarette*\n\nMANSLAVE: -Why don't you give me a little bit of that too?\n\nGOLDMAN: -Here you go.\n\n-See? I'm here to help.\n\nMANSLAVE: -I trust you now.\n\nGOLDMAN: -You trust me?\n\n-Then why don't you start opening up a little bit?\n\nMANSLAVE: -I can open up for ya. But you gotta tell me a few things about yourself that I don't know.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Okay, okay. I'm up for that, but-\n\nMANSLAVE: -Tell me about your father.\n\nGOLDMAN: -My father or my stepfather?\n\nMANSLAVE: -Tell me about your father.\n\nGOLDMAN: -I don't wanna talk about my fath-\n\nMANSLAVE: -Tell me about your FATHER!\n\nGOLDMAN: -I don't wanna talk-\n\nMANSLAVE: -YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FATHER!\n\nGOLDMAN: -My father didn't do shit, all he did was fucking torment my life and fucking make my life a living hell when I was a kid!\n\nMANSLAVE: -Did he ever...Abuse you?\n\nGOLDMAN: -Oh, shut up!\n\nMANSLAVE: -Answer my question.\n\nGOLDMAN: -I don't wanna answer your-This isn't about me, Manslave!\n\nMANSLAVE: -Did your father beat you? Oh god. My father was a carny...On a circus, Rhode Island. 0 to 8,95 and I grew up there. He did things...Things that exist between time and space.\n\n-Can you answer my one question? Why you came here? From Harvaaard. The Harvaaard and the Law Reviiiew, yes? I see by the patterns on your tie which fraternity you belong to.\n\n-You don't think I wasn't Skull and Bones? Heh, you fool. You still haven't answered my question. You need to tell me about your father. Things that you haven't told anybody, not even your diary and the moleskine. Heh. I know you write in that. I know you use your disposable Bic fountain pens and hide them in that. I know your type. Too cheap to buy a good Waterman. Hmph. Ink's too thick and bleeds through the pageees...\n\nGOLDMAN: -I'll give you that, but...\n\nMANSLAVE: -Maybe your father's dead, maybe he's been dead for years, maybe he's been d-\n\nGOLDMAN: -Or maybe-maybe he's the professor?!\n\n-Maybe that's the case, Manslave!\n\nMANSLAVE: -Maybe he couldn't make you love him no matter what he bought you. No matter what he showed you about life, about liberty and about justice.\n\nBADTANMAN: -Yeah, yeah, you're so smart.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Yeah. You-\n\nBADTANMAN: -That's it.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Actually yeah, you're right, that's it. That's my father.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Listen. I need you to light that up.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Okay.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Now light it. \n\n-Light it!\n\nGOLDMAN: -I'm lighting it.\n\n-This thing's too short, Manslave.\n\nMANSLAVE: -Too short? You gotta light it long.\n\n-Now give me a little drag of that because it's been a long time.\n\n-It's been a long time since I've seen my son.\n\nGOLDMAN: -Smoke on that, Manslave. And really suck hard.\n\nMANSLAVE: -I'll take it from here.\n\n*screams*\n\nGOLDMAN: -FUCK!\n\n-I don't know what to do! I can't light the fucking cigarette, I don't have a lighter!\n\nMANSLAVE: -I have lived in the Taj Mahal. And I have lived in the gutter.
