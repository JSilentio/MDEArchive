hillary, and i had looked at wikileaks tweets and didn't see anywhere that they said anything suggesting it'd be anything other than an anniversary thing to do with wikileaks' history. but jones was for sure it'd be a huge bomb dropped on hilldog. watching him get all hyped and speculating about what was gonna be revealed was one of the most embarrassing things i've seen. it's almost indescribable. and it was all his own dumbass fault.\n\ni'm sorry but you jones fans/fanatics out there need to get your bullshit and retard detectors FUCKING FIXED. sandy hook was not a fucking hoax. that theory doesn't even make sense. if alex jones were smart he could've tweaked that theory to suit his 'obama wants to take our guns' narrative but still be believable. here's how- how about the NSA uses its vast database where they can find people who are loners, anti-social, with behavioral issues and even minor past offenses or records at school. and you cross reference those with house holds known to own guns. then you use some chems that the US govt almost surely has developed since or during the MKULTRA days, where they could dope a person like that through their water supply or whatever other means, and this drug would trigger a fight or flight response or just put them in this hightened anxiety mode. you do that AFTER having established contact with them online, using undercover operatives, who say things to plant seeds in the kids' head via a chatroom or watever. so you finally dope them, and they go nuts and shoot some people. and if they don't you do it again with someone else.\n\nto me, THAT is 100% in the realm of possibility. as in, i fully believe the govt has all the tools at their disposal to do that. to actually target vulnerable people, and trigger events they could use politically. but hoaxing the entire shooting? that's fucking retarded. and so is alex jones for saying it, and so are you for believing him, if you did. his theory ideas aren't even at a smart level. they're chump level.\n\nhe could've probably gotten away with talking about the pizzagate thing safely if he didn't have to go into his crazy coke head alex mode where he starts yelling like a fucking retarded, saying shit like 'these people are monsters they need to be locked up!!!!'. that shit was going to catch up to him sooner or later. i'm amazed hes gotten away with it this long. any of you fans of his, get your shit straightened out. you follow fucking morons. and i'm saying this as someone who thinks there are probably some things behind some of the pizzagate stuff. but also as someone who laments the fact that morons like you are partly why trump got elected. i voted on trump. but i'm ashamed that you alex fans did too, and that that's what it took to get
