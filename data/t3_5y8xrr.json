I\u2019ve written white papers for U.N. commissions, for the Trilateral Commission, and for the cosmetics industry as a lobbyist. I have nothing better to do, so I\u2019ll repost some of the info I gave last time. \n\nA seeming contradiction in globalism is that between it\u2019s seemingly \u201csocialist/leftwing\u201d elements and its being advanced by multinational corporations and neoliberal elites. But, this process of globalization is driving toward the creation of the ideal consumer, not the ideal producer. The continuity of production is treated as a given, and this is largely due to automation. With automation handling the vast majority of formerly non-skilled labor production, the goal of the global economic system is the maintenance of the ideal consumer to purchase these commodities. The obvious problem is that these consumers have to have liquid capital to spend on the automation-produced goods. The \u201csocialistic\u201d solution is controlled wealth distribution to allow for product consumption. This might not seem to make sense\u2014redistributing wealth from producers to consumers, so that they can purchase that production\u2014but this cyclical process helps integrate consumers into the consumption process via credit, debt accumulation, and eventually with the onset of cashless society, directed and monitored spending.\nThe other leftist element, identity politics, is a way to co-opt democratic competition. Politics in the twentieth century carried economic weight. The goal was to de-economize politics, so that the citizenry could carry on with democratic politics, but it would not effect the global economic system\u2019s operation. So the population can have political battles, sometimes even substantive, over cultural/identity issues like abortion, gay rights, race, gender, etc., but the outcome would not affect economic activity. In effect, politics was transformed into entertainment, with real administration being transferred to the supranational level\u2014the IMF, World Bank, European Union, etc. This transformation of politics and economic administration largely took place in the late twentieth century. \n\nLastly, my joint work with the cosmetics industry and U.S. intelligence pertained to the \u201ccommodification of identity.\u201d Pre-capitalist forms of identity (race, ethnicity, religion, culture, etc.) pose a threat to the global economic system because these identities provide a basis for popular-democratic resistance to the process of global consumption. There has been a concerted effort to replace traditional identity with post-modern, commodified identity, so that identity consists of purchased consumer products that an individual uses to define himself or herself. This process would also necessitate, as much as possible, the elimination of non-commodified identity, or in other words, the creation of a neo-homogenous population.  \nI was a part of an effort by U.S. intelligence going back to the late 1980s to target Brazil for preliminary experimental efforts. Again, the goal was the commodification of identity to replace traditional identity constructs and the creation of a neo-homogenous population. The racial integrationist aspect has been largely successful. The white-identifying Brazil of the mid-twentieth century was by the 2010s majority non-white, not due to demographic change but due to biological racial integration and identity reconstruction. \n\nMy work specifically had to do with commodifying \u201cfemininity\u201d or \u201cfemale beauty,\u201d so as to undermine tradition, culturally specific, white-centric ideas of female beauty and to replace them with racially non-specific, commodified forms of female beauty. This would both fuel the process of racial integration and open a market for cosmetic improvement, furthering the goals both of U.S. intelligence and the cosmetics industry, for whom I worked. The campaign involved reducing female beauty to a set of non-racial, easily definable characteristics: the breasts and the buttocks. The \u201cbig booty\u201d trend in Brazil makes beauty an acquirable traits rather than something \u201cnatural.\u201d Women of color who would have been excluded from social beauty can now acquire it by simply acquiring the right traits, for purchase through the cosmetics industry. Thus, women of color have a higher likelihood of being found attractive, and racial integration is also advanced.  \nThe Brazilian strategy commenced in the United State with the beginning of the Obama administration. The Trump movement (and the Bernie movement for that matter, with its opposition to neoliberalism) was unforeseen, which you could have probably discerned. Otherwise, the predicted completion of U.S. Brazilianization was approximately 2050. This is still the target, though with new flexibility extending to the end of the century. \n\nI apologize if anything I\u2019ve talked about is hard to understand. I got used to using a very specific language in describing these ideas. Also, for those who are going to argue about this lowering global IQ, though I disagree that that\u2019s a given, it doesn\u2019t matter regardless. Being an ideal consumer does not necessitate high or even above average IQ, and the two might even be inversely correlated.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted here a few months ago. I\u2019ve written white papers for U.N. commissions, for the Trilateral Commission, and for the cosmetics industry as a lobbyist. I have nothing better to do, so I\u2019ll repost some of the info I gave last time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A seeming contradiction in globalism is that between it\u2019s seemingly \u201csocialist/leftwing\u201d elements and its being advanced by multinational corporations and neoliberal elites. But, this process of globalization is driving toward the creation of the ideal consumer, not the ideal producer. The continuity of production is treated as a given, and this is largely due to automation. With automation handling the vast majority of formerly non-skilled labor production, the goal of the global economic system is the maintenance of the ideal consumer to purchase these commodities. The obvious problem is that these consumers have to have liquid capital to spend on the automation-produced goods. The \u201csocialistic\u201d solution is controlled wealth distribution to allow for product consumption. This might not seem to make sense\u2014redistributing wealth from producers to consumers, so that they can purchase that production\u2014but this cyclical process helps integrate consumers into the consumption process via credit, debt accumulation, and eventually with the onset of cashless society, directed and monitored spending.\nThe other leftist element, identity politics, is a way to co-opt democratic competition. Politics in the twentieth century carried economic weight. The goal was to de-economize politics, so that the citizenry could carry on with democratic politics, but it would not effect the global economic system\u2019s operation. So the population can have political battles, sometimes even substantive, over cultural/identity issues like abortion, gay rights, race, gender, etc., but the outcome would not affect economic activity. In effect, politics was transformed into entertainment, with real administration being transferred to the supranational level\u2014the IMF, World Bank, European Union, etc. This transformation of politics and economic administration largely took place in the late twentieth century. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, my joint work with the cosmetics industry and U.S. intelligence pertained to the \u201ccommodification of identity.\u201d Pre-capitalist forms of identity (race, ethnicity, religion, culture, etc.) pose a threat to the global economic system because these identities provide a basis for popular-democratic resistance to the process of global consumption. There has been a concerted effort to replace traditional identity with post-modern, commodified identity, so that identity consists of purchased consumer products that an individual uses to define himself or herself. This process would also necessitate, as much as possible, the elimination of non-commodified identity, or in other words, the creation of a neo-homogenous population.&lt;br/&gt;\nI was a part of an effort by U.S. intelligence going back to the late 1980s to target Brazil for preliminary experimental efforts. Again, the goal was the commodification of identity to replace traditional identity constructs and the creation of a neo-homogenous population. The racial integrationist aspect has been largely successful. The white-identifying Brazil of the mid-twentieth century was by the 2010s majority non-white, not due to demographic change but due to biological racial integration and identity reconstruction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My work specifically had to do with commodifying \u201cfemininity\u201d or \u201cfemale beauty,\u201d so as to undermine tradition, culturally specific, white-centric ideas of female beauty and to replace them with racially non-specific, commodified forms of female beauty.
