That isn't hateful, it's the love of your own country and it's people. I have seen my hometown go from being peaceful like Poland to bombs going off in my workplace and friends being stabbed in the name of Allah. I have had to wrestle a man who was trying to drag my sister into his car. None of those people were traditional British.\nYou don't know what you have till it's gone. I don't feel like my city is my home anymore. I don't understand it anymore. The shop signs aren't even in my own language. That is a horrible feeling I wouldn't wish on anybody. Respect to Poland for keeping its identity and culture.\n\n#####BadgerKomodo 18 points 2 days ago (3 children)\n\"Traditional British\"\nGet over it. Stop wailing about multiculturalism being bad. It is hateful to be like that. So what if it's in another language? People have every right to speak whatever language they bloody well want. Moderate Muslims have the right to exist and don't deserve to be bullied by xenophobic fucks.\n\n#####Turbodon 46 points 2 days ago [removed] (1 children)\nWell I believe you are hateful. You want to force people onto others that just want to be left alone, why ? You must really hate someone if you want to displace them. Because you know that's what happens. White flight occurs in places that have been white for centuries, family and spiritual ties are thrown down the drain in then name of multiculturalism.\nMulticultarilism = where people of different cultures complain about the other groups cultures, resulting in lists of things that are banned or labelled offensive to the point where no real culture is on display. It's shit completely shit. Community spirit is so low compared to how it used to be. But let's call this progressive. Bravo \ud83d\udc4f\nStudies show diversity has a negative effect on communities yet you would call the researcher a racist,xenophobic blah,blah,blah you spend your entire life moaning. Don't tell others they have to get over just because they don't agree with you.\nI think people should have the right to be with their own group but your attitude is NO! That's wrong you must open your borders and allow the one way influx to happen.\nyou conveniently call everyone making their way to Europe refugees, despite the vast majority of the coming from country's that aren't in war. And the immigration is a one way street. I'm not saying they can't speak their own language but your hometown being completely unrecognisable is taking it to far. It's a big world with room for every culture and language to flourish in their own space and modern transport for us all to see what each other's people are Really like. Not this watered down, politically correct, muh food court shit.\n\n#####BadgerKomodo 10 points 2 days ago (3 children)\nYou keep believing that and continue being a miserable bigot. I don't want to do that. I'd rather be an optimistic, tolerant, and welcoming person.\n\n#####Turbodon 39 points 2 days ago [removed] (1 children)\nWell I certainly wont be changing my mind anytime soon, seen as we're now having to deploy soldiers onto the British streets and put up concrete slabs just so that our new neighbours don't have the ability to kill us. Progressive eh, maybe if we let more in we will have tanks on the high street next.\nWhy would anyone be miserable about that right ? They must be a racist,xenophobic,fascistic bluhh fucking bluhhh bigot.\nNobody should care about these labels you throw at them. i certainly don't.\nIf me and my children can live in a homogenous society without grooming gangs, trucks ploughing through our markets, without bombs exploding at public events ,then you can call me every name under the sun. I just don't care. Things can and have been so much better. I have seen it with my own eyes. Respect to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary for having common sense.\n\n#####BadgerKomodo 8 points 2 days ago (3 children)\nYou're worrying far too much. Banning Muslims won't solve anything.\nI was in London about a week after the London Bridge attacks. It was very sad what happened. I'm not the one facilitating terrorism, if anyone is, you are, by bashing Muslims and making them not feel welcome. You're feeding into ISIS' narrative that the West hates all Muslims.\n\n#####Turbodon 26 points a day ago [removed] (1 children)\nI agree it's now to to late for Britain to fully prevent extremist attacks, unless they were to start mass deportations of course but that won't happen so the best thing now is that other countries shouldn't follow our lead. It's not good, it was much better before they arrived en mass.\nIf they don't let Muslims in they won't have Islamic terrorist attacks. It's a simple choice. You can throw every insult you have at that but I see it as the logical and common sense approach.\nThis don't be mean or they will kill you narrative is plain garbage. Never has a terrorist stated he joined Isis or carried out a terrorist attack because of anti-Muslim rhetoric. It's a lie churned out by the mainstream media and politicians but it has no substance or evidence to support it.\nAnother example of this would be : Diversity is our strength lol. So what, united we fall ?\nThey kill each other more than they kill us, That alone should rule that narrative out. They kill because they choose to follow the Quran, the Hadiths and the imams that promote the worst aspects of the two. The guy who bombed the Ariana grande concert was raised by the British taxpayers, his parents were brought in as refugees and also supported by the British taxpayer, never worked yet raised two or more children. That's treating people pretty well in my opinion, but nope. He still goes and kills 22 innocent children. Well innocent to you and me but not to him and the people like him, those kids were degenerate in his eyes. That's all he needed, another possibility was that he had partaken in something that would be seen as degenerate in his religion himself and wanted to free himself of sin.\nThis in my opinion is far,far more dangerous than using anti-Muslim rhetoric, I'd go as far as to say that's one of the main reasons terrorist attacks happen in the west. The west is extremely degenerate in the eyes of Muslims and the degeneracy is being pushed and pushed and pushed. Every other tv advert and movie is gambling, alcohol, drug use, homosexuality etc.. so many vices that would be outlawed in Muslim countries are foisted onto Muslims here. They give in and sorry - no heaven for you, no confession, no prayers, no changing your ways. However - jihad clears one of all sins. Think about how dangerous that belief and loophole is.\nEdit : I'm worrying to much lol ? I work at Manchester arena, the bomb was like 100 yards away from our work area. I went to the same school as Lee Rigby, the lad who was stabbed to death on the streets of London by a Muslim shouting allauha Akhhbar.
