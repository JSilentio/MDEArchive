It&amp;#39;s like unveiling the other side of the spectrum that has been kept deliberately invisible and untouchable in mainstream culture for so long that so many people where I grew up didn&amp;#39;t even consider it valid. Conservatism was hate, as far as the people and local culture who raised me were concerned. There was no balance whatsoever. Just as single dimensional and accepting of other viewpoints as the enemy they so oft criticized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually, even after being refreshed politically and able to see the world through new eyes, to be a layer deeper than most people, dwelling on politics gets old, because you realize so much of it is just a game we choose to play, something we convince ourselves has meaning. A he-said she-said that gives us a chance to express our deeply ingrained passion and frustration into something we feel matters. The more I&amp;#39;ve gone through the motions with it, I see it&amp;#39;s just a game with no winners, and only losers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thankful for the political evolution I was able to ascertain, like being raised westboro baptist and somehow finding your way out, but from the opposite side. But in the end, I think we all have better things we could give attention to in our lives. Places where our attention and effort and desire and passion will have an impact in shaping our reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lvl 1: Left&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lvl 2: Right&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lvl
