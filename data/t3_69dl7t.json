By this logic, the majority of content deemed &amp;quot;ad worthy&amp;quot; is taboo content, like the faux-incest content mentioned above.  One of the easiest ways to shock and get that click is degrading/violent content.  I am not talking anything too extreme at this point, but I believe that sexual violence in pornography will become more and more commonplace.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a small, upcoming site that is not owned by Mindgeek or advertised on any of the tube sites that reinforces this belief.  If you ever surf PH you might have seen some of there stuff in the featured videos section. It&amp;#39;s called &lt;a href=\"http://hookuphotshot.com/\"&gt;Hookup Hotshot&lt;/a&gt; (NSFW obviously) that is basically taking the level of sexual violence you see in Facial Abuse and combining it with a bright and bubbly Tumblr aesthetic.  They cast young, popular porn-stars that are active on social media and all the scenes revolve around the premise that the guy (who they affectionately refer to as &amp;quot;Daddy&amp;quot;) finds these girls on hookup apps like Tinder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am kind running out of steam at this point and need to go eat breakfast, but hopefully this gives you an idea of what and why these things are becoming normalized, as well as the direction things might be headed.  If you have any questions just ask or PM me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/69dl7t/porn_is_way_to_normal_in_our_culture/dh60fit/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dh60fit", "created": 1494022889.0, "author_flair_text": "ryan the wretch", "created_utc": 1493994089.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_69dl7t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_69dl7t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_69dl7t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_69dl7t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_69dl7t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dh6vqwl", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dh6uni8", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "im probably fine, i just saw that destiny thread earlier today and it made me insecure, i cant believe a dude like that can exist and it just made me feel icky and shit and i started getting paranoid about my own frame ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;im probably fine, i just saw that destiny thread earlier today and it made me insecure, i cant believe a dude like that can exist and it just made me feel icky and shit and i started getting paranoid about my own frame &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/69dl7t/porn_is_way_to_normal_in_our_culture/dh6vqwl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dh6vqwl", "created": 1494063164.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1494034364.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dh6uni8", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mistathug", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dh68f6u", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "narrow clavicles ur fucked brah. broad shoulder gang.

really badly, just a son that i can raise properly and see grow up to be a productive, healthy, happy person\" but its going to be fucking impossible. i was born in 1998, i was raised on the internet and i became a big bloated fat sedentary fuck because of video games and web 1.0 bullshit. the biggest problem i have with technology is the physical and endocrinal effect it has on our bodies. this year is the first time in fuckign YEARS that i can do more than 10 push ups. its so fucked up, my body was a fucking product of awful easy babymode society, like a microcosm of that boogie2988 fatass. but the trappings of 2030~ will be much greater than the technological trappings of 2005 and i dont know how you'd raise a kid to avoid those. i would have played sports but video games were easier and low effort and my dad wasnt there so maybe thats why\n&gt; but i still dont want to raise a kid in the hellscape of the 2030s. holy fuck. i saw that amazon wardrobe checker thing the other day and i literally considered suicide. i'm not suicidal at all, i'm pretty happy all around, but sometimes shit just hits me like that. oh my god. the thing is that eventually, amazon alexa is going to be a necessity. it happened with electricity itself, cars, the internet, cellphones, computing. alexa is going to be VITAL for functioning in the future of 2030. there will be no way around it. not having alexa in the 2030s is going to be like not having the internet now.\n&gt; my kid is going to be a fucking slave to to this shit, he's going to have a gay baby ipad or whatever. some people i talk to are like \"uh well, ill just make sure my kid doesnt have an ipad until hes old enough\" yeah well fucko, your kid is going to be a social outcast because he wont be able to relate to the other kids who have ipads. youll fuck him up bad. your kid isnt in your control anymore man. god fucking damn it\n&gt; and hes going to be so into VR porn too, as a 12 year old hes going to plug himself into whatever the 2030s equivilent of newgrounds hentai galleries are and hes going to fucking jack off all the time and shit just like me.\n&gt; i mean maybe not, im not ever going to have kids unless im jacked and aesthetic, so maybe he'll emulate me. i didnt have a dad so maybe thats why everything got so fucked up but i still dont wanna raise a kid in 2030 sex slavery world. sorry\n\nArchived",
