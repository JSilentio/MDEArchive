There are ways of postponing the inevitable (e.g. conquest), but with an inherently inefficient system (socialism disincentivizes productiveness, destroys the work ethic), it will happen sooner or later, always at the expense of the common people. The only thing that a socialist system is capable of producing in surplus is poverty. I'm not sure what you mean by 'rich debt slaves' - if you're referring to the middle class, then I think it's clear how that group has been shrinking over the years - there is simply no room for them under a socialist system, which always results in a trickle-up economy. Of course raising taxation is the only way of sustaining all the social programs designed to render as many people utterly dependent on the state as possible (the precariat). But this cannot be done indefinitely, and the endgame is always a *universal* European revolution catalyzed by a massive crisis. It's nothing more than a cash grab orchestrated by a select revolutionary elite, aided by the precariat. It doesn't need to happen by force, like the Bolshevik revolution did - a totalitarian state can just as well spring out of a democracy, like Nazi Germany. People will vote for anything if the going gets tough enough. And once the old system is toppled, all the extravagant welfare ends, and you go to work, willingly or not. And all the insane leftist rhetoric - LGBT rights, feminism, animal right, the environment - lands in the trash. The Bolsheviks were real big on gay rights (look up Alexandra Kollontai), since sexual minorities are by their very nature in opposition to society, and thus eager supporters of its radical reimagining. And once their job is done and the old system is overthrown, it turns out that they're still in opposition to the new society. And so once the situation in the newly formed Soviet Union stabilizes, Stalin recriminalizes homosexuality and the LGBT community marches off to the GULag in chains, so as not to bother anyone with their gay shit.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the people in the highest echelons of power are always in the end immune to any responsibility - they will always be able to catapult themselves to safety and even benefit from the impending collapse. History has shown this over and over again, every time a totalitarian regime collapses, the elite (save for several unlucky scapegoats) successfully make it out with the cash - because they're the only ones who have economic freedom, since they're able to communicate freely with the outside world.\n\nBy the way, this is the reason USA is itching for a III World War. The socialist policies have reached a tipping point where the country is at a net loss of wealth and an influx of cash is necessary to keep it up longer. It's not a surprise to anybody anymore that the US has become an empire which sustains itself through conquest. Long gone is the model from a century ago where free enterprise and unbridled capitalism generated enough wealth for the country to thrive (that system had plenty of flaws of its own but I don't want to get into that here). I view this as an inevitable consequence of democracy, I posit that universal suffrage must lead to socialism, sooner or later. And as I said earlier, socialism can only be sustained through war or slavery. \n\nNotice how CNN shits on Trump on every possible occasion, EXCEPT the Syrian air strikes and the whole navy thing with North Korea? They took his side then! The American Empire needs this war to keep itself relevant as a world power, and to shift the balance a little, the corporate overlords who run the media know this. The war would chiefly be with Russia, though only by proxy. Trump's recent visit to Warsaw was particularly telling. The way he invoked, if not incited patriotic sentiment fooled many people on the right. I see it as an attempt to recruit Poland to trial by combat, while Russians put up a nation of their own, likely Belarus. The power vacuum which will form after Lukashenko finally croaks might well be the catalyst. Of course this is only going to be one front, and probably that of least importance. The real shit will go down in the Middle East, and the Pacific. Given the current balance of power, it seems that the aim of the war would be to force Russia into an alliance against China. If Russia were to side with China, the US is done (and I don't like the thought of China running the world myself). The value of Russia as a parter lies in the massive amounts of natural resources - their industry is pretty much completely based on selling raw materials, they can't do anything with them. Both China and the US can, and although the West has an edge, China is catching up fast, and their economy is booming. They know how to play the long game and know they have the upper hand, after all, Asia is the only place in the world where wealth actually gets produced.\n\nThis might seem like a contradiction after all I've just said about socialist systems and their economy, but China's \"communism\" is a strange mix of capitalism and totalitarian slavery which manages to stay viable, for now. The Confucian ideology which underpins their culture is also not to be understated, basically it preaches a morality of the individual's sacrifice for the greater good, i.e. the idea of China, the state. Sort of like a colony of ants or bees. This is dramatically different from the Christian ideas in the West, which make the individual divine. I suspect this difference in mentality has a lot to do with how they managed to make the whole communist thing 'work'.\n\nI've gone off on a massive tangent here so apologies, to answer your last question, I don't know. But the point is to wait the beast out and let it starve half to death. If the eurosocialist project fails and the EU isn't allowed to close, and countries like Germany, France still continue their socialist policies domestically, they will cripple themselves to the point of crisis, except now it's every man for himself and it'll be the reactionaries who get voted into power.
