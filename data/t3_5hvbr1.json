Where the fulfilment of the calling cannot directly be related to the highest spiritual and cultural values, or when, on the other hand, it need not be felt simply as economic compulsion, the individual generally abandons the attempt to justify it at all. In the field of its highest development, in the United States, the pursuit of wealth, stripped of its religious and ethical meaning, tends to become associated with purely mundane passions, which often actually give it the character of sport.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one knows who will live in this cage in the future, or whether at the end of this tremendous advancement entirely new prophets will arise, or whether there will be a great rebirth of old ideas and ideals, or, if neither, perhaps a mechanized petrification, embellished with a sort of convulsive self-importance. Then perhaps on the final stage of this cultural development, it might well be truly said:&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of civilization never before achieved.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Max Weber 1905&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5hvbr1/hey_guys/db4n27z/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_db4n27z", "created": 1481630688.0, "author_flair_text": "i know about funny stuff you couldnt even imagine", "created_utc": 1481601888.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "db42rux", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ziacom", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_db40r7l", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;1.
