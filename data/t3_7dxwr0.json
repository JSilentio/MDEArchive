I guess a phrase to best describe what I felt was &amp;quot;Is this all there is to life? Is this my destiny?&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ll skip over the formative teenage years, because I&amp;#39;m sure you can imagine how those went. I discovered self-improvement subreddits like &lt;a href=\"/r/theredpill\"&gt;/r/theredpill&lt;/a&gt; and began bettering myself about 3 years ago. Since then I have transformed into a completely different person, but somehow, I feel as if I truly am who I was meant to be. I am no longer who other people want me to be, or perceive me as, but rather, I have created or discovered my true self. In January-March of 2017 after getting into an accident which stopped me from playing college basketball and really got me into a depressive state, I discovered MDE. I fell into it due to the satirical nature of some of the nihilistic undertones of the group&amp;#39;s works. I then started to realize that this was indeed satire, and that realization really inspired some deep self-realization and introspective thinking. Among float tanks and stoicism, this helped me get out of depression and find my true purpose in life which is in accordance to my actual nature, and not anyone else&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe what is so attractive about &lt;a href=\"/r/MillionDollarExtreme\"&gt;/r/MillionDollarExtreme&lt;/a&gt; is that everyone here comes from the same place. A place of being excluded, a place of thinking of yourself as unworthy of social status, and a place of internal despair. I think that this is why sam&amp;#39;s vertical videos prove to be so popular among the fanbase. This leads to a cult-like tribal mindset, that many would call camaraderie were they not self aware. This cult is hypocritical, harshly anti-individualistic, and carries with it some absolutely astounding levels of group-think. Your run of the mill &lt;a href=\"/r/MillionDollarExtreme\"&gt;/r/MillionDollarExtreme&lt;/a&gt; user claims to think traditionally and be firmly against any degenerate behavior, yet shares memes with each other and regularly uses terms like &amp;quot;doggo&amp;quot; and other juvenile trash terms..........

Stop acting like children and move out of your parents house and get a purpose in life.

If you really believe that you are better than other people, decide right now, to forget about this place and finish your path to improvement. Don&amp;#39;t stop now and be stuck in a stalemate of mediocrity; while you bash video games yet continue to play them, hate popular media but continue to consume it, hate liberal collectivism but continue to partake in equally disgusting groupthink, and while you think of yourself as better than those you constantly make fun of as a group, just know that you are truly no better than a diaper wearing faggot who is 32 years old and on government assistance.
