If we were to apply that same logic of \"my property, my choice\" to post-birth cases as well, then we should legalize throwing babies into trash heaps like the Roman times, because in that scenario the parent wouldn't be obligated to share their property with the child, even if that meant the child's certain death (as is the case with all abortions).
