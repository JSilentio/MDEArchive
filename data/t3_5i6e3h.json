Buzzfeed certainly can&amp;#39;t complain about it being too &amp;quot;offensive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hurtful&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; because of its supposed connection to the alt-right anymore. that whole issue will be settled by [as] listening to that argument and rejecting it by bringing the show back. not sure what people could complain about then if that issue is settled. MDE could even have free reign to be more &amp;quot;edgy&amp;quot; after a while if they become an established program. but i imagine MDE would maybe play it sort of safe for at least one season after being brought back from the dead so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5i6e3h/grassroots_campaign_to_get_mdewp_back_on_air_get/db64ji6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_db64ji6", "created": 1481712600.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1481683800.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5i6e3h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "db69sq9", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_db5z7n9", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8971 \n &gt; [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/68238)", "edited": 1484503667.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/68238\"&gt;What is this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/5i6e3h/grassroots_campaign_to_get_mdewp_back_on_air_get/db69sq9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_db69sq9", "created": 1481720189.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1481691389.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "db5z7n9", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": -3, "parent_id": "t3_5i6e3h", "score": -3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "But when we bring it back, it won't be funny anymore.
