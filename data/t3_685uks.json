The garden people have to do culls where they go rip tonnes of it out of the ground and throw it away.\n\nLegions of science autists that scraped through their exams with sleep deprivation on excesses of adderal might be able to hyperfocus on a DNA code and rearrange it to make the most optimized wheat possible. A \"zippy-wheat\" if you will. But they can't understand mother nature and it's ecosystems and all the plants and their interrelationships. It's a culture of people with their eyes open but they're asleep at the wheel.\n\nRemember the bit about cybernetics in 'All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace' where they put all this information about what type of grass each animal was eating each day and they thought it would predict the future? People are smart but we aren't gods. We cannot meddle with the primal forces of nature. DNA is sacred. Controlling it is far far to powerful, it could create an ultraweed that is completely alien to our planet and completely unstoppable. It's too easy to drop a match and burn down the entire city of london.\n\nPeople like carl sagan talked a lot about how we safely navigated through nuclear proliferation and didn't end up destroying all life on the planet. It makes us feel like we can do anything and get away with it, but this isn't true. There are 'doomsday' seed vaults to help us survive a catastrophe like some crazy GM plant swamping everything else out of existence but catastrophe can be avoided all together by having caution and accepting our human limitations.\n\nBuy [my book on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Slavery-Collected-Kaczynski-k/dp/1932595805) where i go into more detail on this ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s why I am worried about GMO and don&amp;#39;t think it should be done: We have this japanese weed, an alien basically that ended up over here somehow.
