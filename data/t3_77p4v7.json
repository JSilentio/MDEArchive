I\u2019m disappointed that I haven\u2019t gotten a response to my voicemail and text messages.\nFYI, I suggest that you keep in mind that emails sound more impersonal, harsher, and are easier to misinterpret than in-person or phone communication. After all, people can\u2019t see someone\u2019s body language or tone of voice in an email. I\u2019m not trying to be harsh, patronizing, or insulting in this email. I\u2019m honest and direct by nature, and I\u2019m going to be that way in this email. By the way, I did a Google search, so that\u2019s how I came across your email.\nI assume that you no longer want to go out with me. (If you do want to go out with me, then you should let me know.) I suggest that you make a sincere apology to me for giving me mixed signals. I feel led on by you.\nThings that happened during our date include, but are not limited to, the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You played with your hair a lot. A woman playing with her hair is a common sign of flirtation. You can even do a Google search on it. When a woman plays with her hair, she is preening. I\u2019ve never had a date where a woman played with her hair as much as you did. In addition, it didn\u2019t look like you were playing with your hair out of nervousness.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We had lots of eye contact during our date. On a per-minute basis, I\u2019ve never had as much eye contact during a date as I did with you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You said, &amp;#39;It was nice to meet you&amp;#39; at the end of our date. A woman could say this statement as a way to show that she isn\u2019t interested in seeing a man again or she could mean what she said\u2013that it was nice to meet you. The statement, by itself, is inconclusive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We had a nice conversation over dinner. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being delusional in saying this statement.\nIn my opinion, leading someone on (i.e., giving mixed signals) is impolite and immature. It\u2019s bad to do that.\nNormally, I would not be asking for information if a woman and I don\u2019t go out again after a first date. However, in our case, I\u2019m curious because I think our date went well and that there is a lot of potential for a serious relationship. Of course, it\u2019s difficult to predict what would happen, but I think there is a lot of potential for a serious relationship developing between us one day (or least there was before your non-response to my voicemail and text messages).\nI think we should go out on a second date. In my opinion, our first date was good enough to lead to a second date.\nWhy am I writing you? Well, hopefully, we will go out again. Even if we don\u2019t, I gain utility from expressing my thoughts to you. In addition, even if you don\u2019t want to go out again, I would like to get feedback as to why you wouldn\u2019t want to go again. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t ask a woman for this type of feedback after a first date, but this is an exception given I think we have a lot of potential.\nIf you don\u2019t want to go again, then apparently you didn\u2019t think our first date was good enough to lead to a second date. Dating or a relationship is not a Hollywood movie. It\u2019s good to keep that in mind. In general, I thought the date went well and was expecting that we would go out on a second date.\nIf you\u2019re not interested in going out again, then I would have preferred if you hadn\u2019t given those mixed signals. I feel led on. We have a number of things in common. I\u2019ll name a few things: First, we\u2019ve both very intelligent. Second, we both like classical music so much that we go to classical music performances by ourselves. In fact, the number one interest that I would want to have in common with a woman with whom I\u2019m in a relationship is a liking of classical music. I wouldn\u2019t be seriously involved with a woman if she didn\u2019t like classical music. You said that you\u2019re planning to go the NY Philharmonic more often in the future. As I said, I go to the NY Philharmonic often. You\u2019re very busy. It would be very convenient for you to date me because we have the same interests. We already go to classical music performances by ourselves. If we go to classical music performances together, it wouldn\u2019t take any significant additional time on your part.\nAccording to the internet, you\u2019re 33 or 32, so, at least from my point of view, we\u2019re a good match in terms of age. I could name more things that we have in common, but I\u2019ll stop here. I don\u2019t understand why you apparently don\u2019t want to go out with me again. We have numerous things in common. I assume that you find me physically attractive. If you didn\u2019t find me physically attractive, then it would have been irrational for you to go out with me in the first place. After all, our first date was not a blind date.\nYou already knew what I looked like before our date. Perhaps, you\u2019re unimpressed that I manage my family\u2019s investments and my own investments. Perhaps, you don\u2019t think I have a &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; job. Well, I\u2019ve done very well as an investment manager. I\u2019ve made my parents several millions of dollars. That\u2019s real money. That\u2019s not monopoly money. In my opinion, if I make real money, it\u2019s a real job. Donald Trump\u2019s children work for his company. Do they have &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; jobs? I think so. George Soros\u2019 sons help manage their family investments. Do they have &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; jobs? I think so.\nIn addition, I\u2019m both a right-brain and left-brain man, given that I\u2019m both an investment manager and a philosopher/writer. That\u2019s a unique characteristic; most people aren\u2019t like that. I\u2019ve never been as disappointed and sad about having difficulty about getting a second date as I am with you. I\u2019ve gone out with a lot of women in my life. (FYI, I\u2019m not a serial dater. Sometimes, I\u2019ve only gone out with a woman for one date.) People don\u2019t grow on trees. I hope you appreciate the potential we have.\nAm I sensitive person? Sure, I am. I think it\u2019s better to be sensitive than to be insensitive. There are too many impolite, insensitive people in the world.\nI suggest that we continue to go out and see what happens. Needless to say, I find you less appealing now (given that you haven\u2019t returned my messages) than I did at our first date. However, I would be willing to go out with you again. I\u2019m open minded and flexible and am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. I wish you would give me the benefit of the doubt too.\nIf you don\u2019t want to go out again, in my opinion, you would be making a big mistake, perhaps one of the biggest mistakes in your life. If you don\u2019t want to go out again, then you should have called to tell me so. Even sending a text message would have been better than nothing. In my opinion, not responding to my messages is impolite, immature, passive aggressive, and cowardly. I spent time, effort, and money meeting you for dinner. Getting back to me in response to my messages would have been a reasonable thing for you to do. In addition, you arrived about 30 minutes late for our date. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t like it if a man showed up thirty minutes late for a first date with you.\nIf you\u2019re concerned that you will hurt my feelings by providing specific information about why you don\u2019t want to go with me again, well, my feelings are already hurt. I\u2019m sad and disappointed about this situation. If you give information, at least I can understand the situation better. I might even learn something that is beneficial.\nIf you don\u2019t want to go out again, that I request that you call me and make a sincere apology for leading me on (i.e., giving me mixed signals). In my opinion, you shouldn\u2019t act that way toward a man and then not go out with him again. It\u2019s bad to play with your hair so much and make so much eye contact if you\u2019re not interested in going out with me again. I have tried to write this email well, but it\u2019s not perfect. Again, I\u2019m not trying to be harsh, insulting, patronizing, etc. I\u2019m disappointed, sad, etc.\nI would like to talk to you on the phone. I hope you will call me back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (if it\u2019s inconvenient for you to talk on the phone when you read this email, you can let me know via email that you are willing to talk on the phone and I\u2019ll call you). If you get my voicemail, you can a leave a message and I can call you back. Even if you don\u2019t want to go out again, I would appreciate it if you give me the courtesy of calling me and talking to me. Yes, you might say things that hurt me, but my feelings are already hurt.\nSending me an email response (instead of talking on the phone) would better than no response at all, but I think it would be better to talk on the phone. Email communication has too much potential for misinterpretation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best, Mike&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi Lauren,\n \nI\u2019m disappointed in you.
