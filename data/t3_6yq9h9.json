When married (to a good woman) you love your wife right? The two of you compliment each other&amp;#39;s personality and strive to lead a good family. She&amp;#39;s the most important woman in the world to you and because you&amp;#39;re her man, the two of you get intimate daily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretend it&amp;#39;s a friday night and the two of you just had an excellent dinner at a fine eatery. Y&amp;#39;all have been laughing all night just loving eachother&amp;#39;s company. On the ride home, your wife reaches over and presses her hand on your crotch. She leans over and kisses you on the neck as you drive your 2018 Miata 20 over down the empty highway. As you pull down your pants to recieve road head, ask yourself right now, what are you thinking about? A good man is exhilarated about the blow job he&amp;#39;s about to recieve from the woman he adores. That should be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What isn&amp;#39;t the answer is, &amp;quot;Golly, better wash my dick with soap and water before my wife sucks it!!&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s dumb. A wee-wee is just more skin. Unless you piss your pants still, there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with the woman you love sucking on your member. Now, I believe that correlates to washing your hands after you take a piss. If your skin touches some more of your skin, and you don&amp;#39;t make any accidental dribblys on yourself, it makes 0 sense to wash your hands after you leak your lizard. That is my belief and that is what I stand by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However... I work in a large corporation and have illusions of grandeur about where I&amp;#39;ll end up by the end of the decade. I want promotions, I want the salary and I want the stress. Office jobs are easy if you&amp;#39;re able to manage your time and stay level headed. Because of that motivation, I wash my hands in the bathroom at work to keep at bay the thoughts of any potential new boss who may be in there with me. I wanna look &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; to these corporate fucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for the backstory. In the bathrooms here there are the damn dyson hand driers that spread the dirty water of everyone else who used them that day onto your hands, and there are some good ol Christian paper towels that you can use as well if you have half a brain. What ain&amp;#39;t so great is the fact that these paper towels are incased in some pansy ass automatic dispenser. What ain&amp;#39;t so great about the dispenser is that it unrolls you about 3 inches of paper towel and then has a 20 second delay after doing so before the motion sensor will dispense another 3 inches of paper towel. You gotta stand there for 2 minutes to accumulate enough paper towels to dry your hands (unless you&amp;#39;re a manlet). That shit drove me nuts and today I finally did something about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After washing my hands in the potty room (only cause some suits were in there), I walked up to the paper towel dispenser, dreading the eon I was about to endure. As the little gears in the hippy machine whirred, I finally snapped. I grabbed the inch of the paper towel that was still dispensing and pulled down on it at just the right angle. The little gears whirred in pain as I pulled fast and hard until I had the 3 feet I needed to dry my hands. Taught that faggot machine a lesson today and fuck brutha, it felt gewd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Sup fellow Extreme-ey's?\n\nI've been a nice dude my whole life but I just lived the roll of a bully and it was exhilarating.\n\nLemme give you a backstory....\n\nActually, first let me explain something.
