It is a beautiful combination of intense pressure and perhaps even a bit of discomfort, and the thrill of knowing that, at some point, you will be able to let go and feel the relief that floods through your entire body as you get rid of everything that has been building up inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love to relieve myself in different places so that I can enjoy the way that it feels as it happens \u2013 I love to stand underneath the shower and empty my bladder and feel the wet warmth of it mixing in with the water as it runs down my legs. I love the feeling of needing to poop and then pushing it out into my underwear, where it is deliciously warm and solid, or perhaps sometimes a bit loose or even runny, against my butt. If I do decide to poop in the toilet \u2013 which is not very often \u2013 I still love the way that it gently stretches my anus wide open as it makes its way out and then falls with a satisfying plop into the water below it.

Their smells are very natural, and I enjoy them for that reason. My pee doesn\u2019t usually have much of a smell because I drink a lot of water, but sometimes I can pick up a faint hint of it. My poop always has a distinctive odour to it which could be perceived as unpleasant by others because it is thick and strong. Sometimes it has that typical \u201crotten cabbage\u201d smell (which usually happens if I eat a lot of vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and so on) and if I eat a lot of meat, my poop tends to be much stinkier than normal. I usually breathe in the smell of my poop whilst I\u2019m letting it out, and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I love it. My body is getting rid of the waste products that it no longer needs, and I\u2019m entitled to enjoy every step of the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love the way that healthy poop and pee look; it\u2019s such a turn-on to see my own bodily functions after I\u2019ve performed them, or to see someone else\u2019s and imagine the relief that it must have brought them. I especially enjoy watching videos that show poop and pee coming out, because I love seeing the different colours and textures that people can make. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I love the fact that the toilet is by far not the only place in which to relieve oneself; anywhere and anything can serve as a toilet with a bit of imagination and an open mind (and some air freshener and bleach for afterwards!). I personally have urinated and/or defecated in the following places: in a chamber pot, in a bucket, in the bath (with and without water in it), on the carpet, in the sink, in a glass, on a chair, in bed, in my underwear, in a swimming pool, on the floor, on the beach, in a car, and in the shower.
