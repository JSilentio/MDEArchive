Also, \n\n&gt;Happiness does come from work, from work and subsequent reward, which humans are lacking in modern day. Happiness is not inherently hedonistic, because true happiness is achieved through sweat.\n\nIt's really only a thing in some western countries, most noteably, the US, that people think work sucks, and that mindset is mainly because statistically speaking, people in the US work a huge amount for shit pay compared to many other first world countries, and don't give enough back to the people who work for whatever company or organization. People aren't going to enjoy working if they just get fucked by their employer. \n\nOf course happiness comes from working hard and feeling rewarded from whatever that work came from, but if you work too much and get very little in return, then it isn't worth it. People back in the hunter gather times were also rewarded from hunting, by getting food as a result of it. Literally all work is supposed to be reprimanded in some way.\n\nAnd also I go to school and learn about science because i find it interesting and it makes me happy. I also like the thought that other people could benefit from the work that I do. The work I do when i study is reprimanded with a good grade and I feel fulfilled when that happens.\n\nYes, people all want to make themselves happy, but you shouldn't make yourself happy at the expense of others. You should be courteous to the people around you and be somewhat self aware of your own actions. \n\n&gt;I just think it's a little bit funny that you believe you can actually even begin to comprehend what is actually going on. \n\nI never said I did, I just said I was interested in understanding it, stop putting words into my mouth you douche, and stop being so condescending.\n\n&gt;Those closest to absolute enlightenment have not been scientists, they've been spiritually driven people.\n\nNo, it has literally nothing to do with spiritual enlightenment, it was because they were curious people who wanted answers for why things are the way that they are, and were actually interested in things like math and science. So they developed theories and laws that were able to pass rigorous tests so see if they would work in describing the way the universe worked.\n\nAlso, there is nothing spiritual about the scientific method. The entire point of it is to look at things as objective as possible to develop a working system for whatever phenomena needs explaining. People like Einstein or newton were smart because they looked at things logically and curiously with as little bias as possible. Science is all based off of observation.\n\nThere's also no such thing as being \"spiritually driven\" all it is a combination of being more curious, and interested in certain things than others. Literally anybody could learn physics, calculus or chemistry if they gave enough of a shit about any of it. \n\n&gt;You cannot achieve enlightenment through logic, because the universe does not act in a logical manner.\n\nTrue the universe doesn't behave by the theories we have come up with, but through logic, observation and experimentation we can come up with theories that do explain the universe near perfectly as far as we know. We can describe the movements of galaxies and formations of solar systems with general relativity because Einstein (and many other unnamed scientists who have built upon it) found a formula that worked really well.\n\n&gt;because we had to, because our population was getting out of control, and with the advent of transportation systems we began mingling with different types of people. It was a necessity to interact with other cultural groups, we didn't do it because we all got together one day and said \"hey I think we should be kinder to our fellow man\", we did it because it was the path of least resistance.\n\nSo what if it's the path of least resistance? It still leads to us being kinder to others, because being kinder to others is better for survival. You're literally just arguing semantics. Also, our population has growing at a slower and slower rate, as I said before all population growth is logistical, and it's really only poorer countries that are growing at such a high rate. If they were more educated and had access to better technology it wouldn't be an issue.\n\n", "edited": 1476250872.0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;#39;s not hard to have a functioning civilization with people who are relatively healthy, plenty of Scandinavian countries and japan do that really well.

People aren&amp;#39;t going to enjoy working if they just get fucked by their employer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course happiness comes from working hard and feeling rewarded from whatever that work came from, but if you work too much and get very little in return, then it isn&amp;#39;t worth it. People back in the hunter gather times were also rewarded from hunting, by getting food as a result of it. Literally all work is supposed to be reprimanded in some way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also I go to school and learn about science because i find it interesting and it makes me happy. I also like the thought that other people could benefit from the work that I do. The work I do when i study is reprimanded with a good grade and I feel fulfilled when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, people all want to make themselves happy, but you shouldn&amp;#39;t make yourself happy at the expense of others. You should be courteous to the people around you and be somewhat self aware of your own actions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just think it&amp;#39;s a little bit funny that you believe you can actually even begin to comprehend what is actually going on. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never said I did, I just said I was interested in understanding it, stop putting words into my mouth you douche, and stop being so condescending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those closest to absolute enlightenment have not been scientists, they&amp;#39;ve been spiritually driven people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, it has literally nothing to do with spiritual enlightenment, it was because they were curious people who wanted answers for why things are the way that they are, and were actually interested in things like math and science. So they developed theories and laws that were able to pass rigorous tests so see if they would work in describing the way the universe worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, there is nothing spiritual about the scientific method. The entire point of it is to look at things as objective as possible to develop a working system for whatever phenomena needs explaining. People like Einstein or newton were smart because they looked at things logically and curiously with as little bias as possible. Science is all based off of observation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also no such thing as being &amp;quot;spiritually driven&amp;quot; all it is a combination of being more curious, and interested in certain things than others. Literally anybody could learn physics, calculus or chemistry if they gave enough of a shit about any of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot achieve enlightenment through logic, because the universe does not act in a logical manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True the universe doesn&amp;#39;t behave by the theories we have come up with, but through logic, observation and experimentation we can come up with theories that do explain the universe near perfectly as far as we know. We can describe the movements of galaxies and formations of solar systems with general relativity because Einstein (and many other unnamed scientists who have built upon it) found a formula that worked really well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;because we had to, because our population was getting out of control, and with the advent of transportation systems we began mingling with different types of people. It was a necessity to interact with other cultural groups, we didn&amp;#39;t do it because we all got together one day and said &amp;quot;hey I think we should be kinder to our fellow man&amp;quot;, we did it because it was the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what if it&amp;#39;s the path of least resistance? It still leads to us being kinder to others, because being kinder to others is better for survival. You&amp;#39;re literally just arguing semantics. Also, our population has growing at a slower and slower rate, as I said before all population growth is logistical, and it&amp;#39;s really only poorer countries that are growing at such a high rate. If they were more educated and had access to better technology it wouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/56x9op/political_post_extremely_important_nyc_democratic/d8odx7v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_d8odx7v", "created": 1476275419.0, "author_flair_text": "Courtney Love shot tupac", "created_utc": 1476246619.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d8o92oi", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Psychedelican", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d8o3mbt", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Happiness does not come from stuffing your face with Dunkin' Donuts and drinking a frappe from Starbucks, sorry to break it to you.
