Needless to say, don't pursue a career through craigslist. The pictures were lies. \n\nOn my first day I am working the door and Charls tells me that there is a man laying in a hallway upstairs. I go to check it out. There is a guy laying in the hallway barely conscious. Call for medical and an ambulance crew shows up. They roll in, one guy looks at him for 10 seconds and says 'he is just drunk' and they all leave. Guy is still laying there. I call Sam and he basically tells me that he isn't our problem and to just toss him into the streets. He said the guy \"couldn't keep up\" and was \"living in antiquity\". So then the guy is trying to put a key into his belt loop. He tries this several times. I ask \"what are you doing\" and he replies, \"trying to get this door open\". I hadn't really looked at this guy closely until then and I notice that this man is Nick and his eyes are indigo. I mean he is like dying, and his skin is Simpsons yellow. I had never seen indigo eyes before, nor jaundice. I call Sam and say this guy is dying, but Sam just laughs and says \"what you gonna do about it?\"\n\n\n\nSo I call for medical again and ask that they send a different ambulance company (we have several here). The new crew rolls in and check the guy's vitals and say that they need to transport because the guy will die if he does not get to the ER soon. The first crew that came in just didn't want to deal with the paperwork and the chance of not getting paid. The guy did die shortly after. At this point Sam came out through a red door that seemed to just materialize in thin air and he said \"we need to bury this fuckin' body man, I've got some chocolate milk on me\". It took me a while to realize that the chocolate milk was my payment for becoming complicit in what was essentially a murder.\n\n\nAt no time during my employment have the conditions improved. Every day seems to be worse than the last. And I've yet to be paid in anything other than chocolate milk cartons.\n\nThere have been thefts, suicides, gang fights, fires, drugs, crazy people off their medications, naked people in what we call the \"lobby\", homeless people camping in the basement, pissing or worse in the elevators, and every room in the building is either *far* too hot or *far* too cold. I saved a family of 6 from a fire a few days ago.\n\n\n\nThe thing that drives me insane is the loud music in the \"lobby\". I climbed up and cut the speaker cord myself several times to shut it off. That cord was the only thing maintenance would actually fix.
