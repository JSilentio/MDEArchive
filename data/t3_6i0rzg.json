Ask yourself, what kind of a person that possesses the necessary knowledge to be a fantastic petroleum engineer/architect/programmer/painter/musician/whatever would give up on a very lucrative and fulfilling career and instead spend time repeating the factoids they memorized several years ago EVERY year for the next 20 years? The answer is simple: the kind that &amp;#39;did well in school&amp;#39;, but has no value aside from this academic posturing - or the kind of a petty tyrant one might find in a driving exam commission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Educational institutions (just like any other business that wishes to sell you something) reward appearance - THIS is what kids really learn in these places. The belief in &amp;#39;good citizen crafting programs&amp;#39; is no more than a logical conclusion of the egalitarian ideals we are beholden to, with no basis in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6i0rzg/pretty_obvious_collegeuni_are_designed_to_extend/dj2sqnn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dj2sqnn", "created": 1497845014.0, "author_flair_text": "Socialism is the Flat Earth theory of economics", "created_utc": 1497816214.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6i0rzg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dj2tqjq", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dogsn1", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_6i0rzg", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I don't think any of this stuff is new, what's your take on hippies and other similar groups from the past?\n\nThe thing that is new is the increase in people going to universities and the small brain courses they choose, I don't think that stuff should be happening.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think any of this stuff is new, what&amp;#39;s your take on hippies and other similar groups from the past?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing that is new is the increase in people going to universities and the small brain courses they choose, I don&amp;#39;t think that stuff should be happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6i0rzg/pretty_obvious_collegeuni_are_designed_to_extend/dj2tqjq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dj2tqjq", "created": 1497846355.0, "author_flair_text": "He might only be 5'7 but I look up to him", "created_utc": 1497817555.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vsta", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6i0rzg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dj2usis", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrownedCaribou", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_6i0rzg", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "unfortunately for those people the real world won't hesitate to smack them in the face.  \n\nbut I just worry if the fall will affect us all, you're right that the population is super tame, and the technology to control it is more powerful than ever.
