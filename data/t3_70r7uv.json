probably not, i think chicks with dicks are weird, but i still think of her as a chick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i think of it like this, if you are like &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m dressed like a cyber punk&amp;quot;, and someone responds &amp;quot;i actually see you more as a space cowboy&amp;quot; no one will freak the fuck out because we accept that aesthetics and fashion are largely subjective.  so i think the same should apply to gender, if you are like &amp;quot;i identify as a genderless alien from the planet unikron&amp;quot; and someone responds &amp;quot; i see you more as a boy&amp;quot; that shouldn&amp;#39;t get someone sent to a human rights tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;like david bowie didn&amp;#39;t need to fucking force people to see him as the weird alien gender he was presenting as during the seventies, when he was ziggy stardust, most people got that he was being an adrogenous alien because he effectively expressed him self like that, and the people that didn&amp;#39;t? who fucking gives a shit, its just fashion. thats the reasonable way to handle it i think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so to sum it up&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr who gives a fuck what someone says is there gender so long as it doesn&amp;#39;t coerce me to live my life any differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/70r7uv/dude_have_you_been_to_rthe_donald_lately_based/dniqx8g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dniqx8g", "created": 1506432485.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1506403685.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dnic4nm", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Field_Of_View", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dn8bih2", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You're fighting a strawman.
