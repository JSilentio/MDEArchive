She works so much she doesn&amp;#39;t even have friends anymore, since all girls her age want to do is go clubbing all the time and she isn&amp;#39;t into it at all. I&amp;#39;m really all she&amp;#39;s got other than family and you could say I have that power over her. Though I don&amp;#39;t wish to make her feel trapped either. Fortunately I don&amp;#39;t think we will break up, after 7 years and 2 living together we can still spend a lot of time together and enjoy it, she also doesn&amp;#39;t keep me from my guy friends or stop me from doing what I want at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6t6kui/i_went_on_a_date_today_guys/dliz0vk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dliz0vk", "created": 1502588484.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1502559684.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dliwfp0", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dlihqxn", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1509342355.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": true, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/6t6kui/i_went_on_a_date_today_guys/dliwfp0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dliwfp0", "created": 1502585146.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1502556346.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dlihqxn", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_6t6kui", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Man the idea of a date scares the shit out of me.
