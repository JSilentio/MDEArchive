And it seems most white kids these days awkwardly try to cling to ghetto culture, even though they live in big suburban houses with 3 car garages, so it just comes off cringy and unauthentic. Because being \"white\" is shameful, they have to pretend to be something else. \n\nWe need to get men to stop being pussies and urironically start caring about themselves and the people around them. They need to start lifting, eat better, get in shape. They need to not be ashamed to show masculinity and confidence. They need to read a book -\n a *real* book, not fucking Harry Potter. Culture has gone down the toilet because we worship the victim, we are the absolute epitome of Nietzsche's slave values, we are his Last Men. We need to look up to the Strong again. Weaklings have taken over society and they try to shame the strong to excuse their own incompetencies. We need a real social revolution - and I think it's coming - people are getting fed up with this SJW crap. People are getting tired of being shamed for being white, or male, or strong, or successful. We can do this guys. Start lifting, start improving yourself, find good, strong, moral women, and make babies and raise healthy families and communities.\n\nA wiki summary of the Last Man: \n\"The Last man, or the Last race (German: Letzter Mensch), is a term used by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in Thus Spoke Zarathustra to describe **the antithesis of his imagined superior being, the \u00dcbermensch, whose imminent appearance is heralded by Zarathustra. The last men are tired of life, take no risks, and seek only comfort and security.**\n\nThe last man's primary appearance is in \"Zarathustra's Prologue.\" According to Nietzsche, the last man is the goal that modern society and Western civilization have apparently set for themselves. After having unsuccessfully attempted to get the populace to accept the \u00dcbermensch as the goal of society, Zarathustra confronts them with a goal so disgusting that he assumes that it will revolt them.[1] Zarathustra fails in this attempt, and instead of repelling and manipulating the populace into pursuing the goal of the \u00dcbermensch, the populace take Zarathustra literally and choose the \"disgusting\" goal of becoming the last men. This decision made leaves Zarathustra disheartened and disappointed.\n\n**The lives of the last men are pacifist and comfortable. There is no longer a distinction between ruler and ruled, strong over weak or supreme over the mediocre. Social conflict and challenges are minimized. Every individual lives equally and in \"superficial\" harmony. There are no original or flourishing social trends and ideas. Individuality and creativity are suppressed.**\n\n**Nietzsche warned that the society of the last man could be too barren and decadent to support the growth of healthy human life or great individuals. The last man is only possible by mankind having bred an apathetic person or ethnic group who are unable to dream, who are unwilling to take risks, and simply earn their living and keep warm. The society of the last man is antithetical to Nietzsche's theoretical will to power, the main driving force and ambition behind human nature, according to Nietzsche, as well as all other life in the universe.**\n\nThe last man, Nietzsche predicted, would be one response to the problem of nihilism. But the full implications of the death of God had yet to unfold: \"The event itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude's capacity for comprehension even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet.\"[2]\"\n\nAlthough I would really suggest reading Thus Spake Zarathustra directly. Academia has essentially neutered Nietzsche - it's better to read him directly than take a professor's word for it.

And it seems most white kids these days awkwardly try to cling to ghetto culture, even though they live in big suburban houses with 3 car garages, so it just comes off cringy and unauthentic. Because being &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; is shameful, they have to pretend to be something else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to get men to stop being pussies and urironically start caring about themselves and the people around them. They need to start lifting, eat better, get in shape. They need to not be ashamed to show masculinity and confidence. They need to read a book -\n a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; book, not fucking Harry Potter. Culture has gone down the toilet because we worship the victim, we are the absolute epitome of Nietzsche&amp;#39;s slave values, we are his Last Men. We need to look up to the Strong again. Weaklings have taken over society and they try to shame the strong to excuse their own incompetencies. We need a real social revolution - and I think it&amp;#39;s coming - people are getting fed up with this SJW crap. People are getting tired of being shamed for being white, or male, or strong, or successful. We can do this guys. Start lifting, start improving yourself, find good, strong, moral women, and make babies and raise healthy families and communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A wiki summary of the Last Man: \n&amp;quot;The Last man, or the Last race (German: Letzter Mensch), is a term used by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in Thus Spoke Zarathustra to describe &lt;strong&gt;the antithesis of his imagined superior being, the \u00dcbermensch, whose imminent appearance is heralded by Zarathustra. The last men are tired of life, take no risks, and seek only comfort and security.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last man&amp;#39;s primary appearance is in &amp;quot;Zarathustra&amp;#39;s Prologue.&amp;quot; According to Nietzsche, the last man is the goal that modern society and Western civilization have apparently set for themselves. After having unsuccessfully attempted to get the populace to accept the \u00dcbermensch as the goal of society, Zarathustra confronts them with a goal so disgusting that he assumes that it will revolt them.[1] Zarathustra fails in this attempt, and instead of repelling and manipulating the populace into pursuing the goal of the \u00dcbermensch, the populace take Zarathustra literally and choose the &amp;quot;disgusting&amp;quot; goal of becoming the last men. This decision made leaves Zarathustra disheartened and disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lives of the last men are pacifist and comfortable. There is no longer a distinction between ruler and ruled, strong over weak or supreme over the mediocre. Social conflict and challenges are minimized. Every individual lives equally and in &amp;quot;superficial&amp;quot; harmony. There are no original or flourishing social trends and ideas. Individuality and creativity are suppressed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nietzsche warned that the society of the last man could be too barren and decadent to support the growth of healthy human life or great individuals. The last man is only possible by mankind having bred an apathetic person or ethnic group who are unable to dream, who are unwilling to take risks, and simply earn their living and keep warm. The society of the last man is antithetical to Nietzsche&amp;#39;s theoretical will to power, the main driving force and ambition behind human nature, according to Nietzsche, as well as all other life in the universe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last man, Nietzsche predicted, would be one response to the problem of nihilism. But the full implications of the death of God had yet to unfold: &amp;quot;The event itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude&amp;#39;s capacity for comprehension even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet.&amp;quot;[2]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I would really suggest reading Thus Spake Zarathustra directly. Academia has essentially neutered Nietzsche - it&amp;#39;s better to read him directly than take a professor&amp;#39;s word for it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/7eod0h/is_the_collapse_of_western_civilization_actually/dq76ybs/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dq76ybs", "created": 1511402935.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1511374135.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dq6zmry", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "XxXMoonManXxX", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_7eod0h", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Maybe it's nothing but my generation (Gen Z) jokes about killing ourselves multiple times a day and I have no doubt in my mind alot of us aren't joking anymore.
