But even in Rome there was nothing like the non-stop distractions now provided by newspapers and magazines, by radio, television and the cinema. In &amp;quot;Brave New World&amp;quot; non-stop distractions of the most fascinating nature are deliberately used as instruments of policy, for the purpose of preventing people from paying too much attention to the realities of the social and political situation. The other world of religion is different from the other world of entertainment; but they resemble one another in being most decidedly &amp;quot;not of this world.&amp;quot; Both are distractions and, if lived in too continuously, both can become, in Marx&amp;#39;s phrase &amp;quot;the opium of the people&amp;quot; and so a threat to freedom. Only the vigilant can maintain their liberties, and only those who are constantly and intelligently on the spot can hope to govern themselves effectively by democratic procedures. A society, most of whose members spend a great part of their time, not on the spot, not here and now and in their calculable future, but somewhere else, in the irrelevant other worlds of sport and soap opera, of mythology and metaphysical fantasy, will find it hard to resist the encroachments of those would manipulate and control it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Aldous Huxley 1958&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/7fzak5/the_year_is_2070_every_citizen_is_inclined_to/dqfp6x6/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dqfp6x6", "created": 1511863795.0, "author_flair_text": "Now where could my pipe be?", "created_utc": 1511834995.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dqfjlyw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DiethylamideProphet", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_7fzak5", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Nah.
