This is just the way it is, Europe is being invaded and we'd better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here.\n\n \n\nIt's possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate. Send them money, let them use the technology we invented, give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty, quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good, but by keeping borders open we're taking the most productive, inventive, civilized, free countries and dumping them into the incinerator. Of course we have problems, of course the NSA is bad, of course it would be nice if we could all have $15 an hour for whatever, but would you rather live here, or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia?

We're putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we're worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us.\n\n \n\nWe didn't build all this shit and invent all this shit, our ancestors did--it's only ours to safeguard, not to flush down the toilet. You didn't get burned at the stake for saying something heretical, your ancestors did, so it's pretty fucking shameful if you're ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you. These fuckers have shifted everything so far out of wack and to not fight back now is the same thing as being on their side.\n\n \n\nComedy shouldn't be 'political'...

The slow smothering death of Western Civilization is not a political issue, it's a historical issue, as in we are toying with the fruits of 2000 years of bloody labor as if they're just piNata prizes.\n\n \n\nI don't want to shove politics in everyone's face all the time. I happen to think that free-market capitalism kicks socialism's ass and that spying and war are bad. I voted for Gary Johnson in 2012. If you think that a universal basic income is a good idea, or that weed should remain illegal, or think whatever about gay marriage, I don't care about those things enough to alienate viewers and I'm trying to shove my opinions in your face as little as possible. Even if you think that people are born boys and turn into girls, whatever, I think Bruce Jenner is really funny but I don't care enough to go beyond making jokes about ropes.
