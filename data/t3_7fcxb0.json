It's just impossible, the only way that could happen is if the only websites were these major websites. \n\nDo you think they are going to put a huge cost on browsing Wikipedia or some very obscure text based site?

This is what you are arguing for. \n\nYeah that is effectively an internet firewall, and if that happens at least then everyone can widely agree that the internet is censored like China and we can start moving in a big way to combat it.\n\nRight now people think the internet is open and free, which is far from the truth. Its open and free to all sorts of degeneration, drugs, porn without warning popups, etc.\n\nAgain I repeat do you really think it is possible to censor text on the internet?\n\n&gt;Yes, there are issues with big corporations like Netflix and Google using way more bandwidth than reasonable for the prices they pay, that doesn't mean you just give the ISPs the right to fuck everyone they wish in any way they wish.
