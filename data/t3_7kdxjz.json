In early May 1944, H\u00f6ss briefly returned to Auschwitz-Birkenau to take up his command again during the Hungarian Action. After the war, H\u00f6ss was arrested, tried, convicted and put to death for his role in the Final Solution. Before he was executed he wrote his memoirs in which he noted: \u201cOriginally, all the Jews transported to [Auschwitz-Birkenau] . . . were to be destroyed without exception, according to Himmler\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\n&gt;However, because of labor needs in the armaments industry by 1942 some able-bodied Jews were saved as workers. According to H\u00f6ss: \u201cThe railways cars were unloaded one after another. After depositing their baggage, the Jews had to individually pass in front of an SS doctor, who decided on their physical fitness as they marched past him. Those who were considered able-bodied were immediately escorted into the camp in small groups.

After the war, H\u00f6ss was arrested, tried, convicted and put to death for his role in the Final Solution. Before he was executed he wrote his memoirs in which he noted: \u201cOriginally, all the Jews transported to [Auschwitz-Birkenau] . . . were to be destroyed without exception, according to Himmler\u2019s orders.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, because of labor needs in the armaments industry by 1942 some able-bodied Jews were saved as workers.
