This is the First Commandment in all of God\u2019s scriptures, including the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Final Testament\n\nLike the Quran itself, the Quran\u2019s mathematical coding ranges from the very simple, to the very complex. The Simple Facts about the Quranic mathematical code of 19 are those observations that can be ascertained without using any tools. The complex facts require the assistance of a calculator or a computer:\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #1. The first verse (1:1), known as \u201cBasmalah,\u201d consists of 19 letters (Basmalah: image with letters marked).\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #2. The Quran consists of 114 suras, which is \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..19 x 6.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #3. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or \u2026.19 x 334.\n\n[6234 numbered verses &amp; 112 un-numbered verses (Basmalahs) 6234+112 = 6346] Note that 6+3+4+6 =\u2026\u2026.19.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #4. The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) &amp; 114= 19x6.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #5. From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27, there are precisely \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202619 suras.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #6. It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 (9+10+11+12+\u2026+26+27) is 342, or \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.19 x 18.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #7. This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmalahs of Sura 27, and 342 = \u2026\u2026..19 x 18.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #8. The famous first revelation (96:1-5) consists of \u2026\u2026.19 words.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #9. This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters .19 x 4.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #10. Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of \u2026. 19 verses.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #11. This first chronological sura is placed atop the last ..19 suras.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #12. Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters, and 304 equals .19 x 16.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #13. The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of \u2026\u2026\u2026\u202619 words.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #14. The first verse of the last revelation (110:1) consists of \u2026\u2026.. 19 letters.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #15. 14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of \u201cQuranic Initials\u201d (such as A.L.M. of 2:1), and prefix 29 suras. These numbers add up to 14+14+29 = 57 = \u2026\u202619 x 3.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #16. The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic Initials occur is 2+3+7+\u2026+50+68 = 822, and 822+14 (14 sets of initials) equals 836, or \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 19 x 44.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #17. Between the first initialed sura (Sura 2) and the last initialed sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras 19 x 2.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #18. Between the first and last initialed sura there are \u2026.19 sets of alternating \u201cinitialed\u201d and \u201cun-initialed\u201d suras.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #19. The Quran mentions 30 different numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 99, 100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 50000, &amp; 100000. The sum of these numbers is 162146, which equals 19x8534.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #20. By counting the letter \u201cQ\u201d in every \u201cVerse 19\u201d throughout the Quran, the total count comes to 76, 19\u00d74. Here is a summary of the Q-related data\n\nMiracle 19 Fact #21 NuN (Noon) This initial is unique; it occurs in one sura, 68, and the name of the letter is spelled out as three letters \u2014 Noon Wow Noon \u2014 in the original text and is therefore counted as two N\u2019s. The total count of this letter in the N-initialed sura is 133, 19\u00d77. The fact that \u201cN\u201d is the last Quranic Initial (see Table 1) brings out a number of special observations. For example, the number of verses from the first Quranic Initial (A.L.M. of 2:1) to the last initial (N. of 68:1) is 5263, or 19\u00d7277. The word \u201cGod\u201d (Allah) occurs 2641 (19\u00d7139) times between the first initial and the last initial. Since the total occurrence of the word \u201cGod\u201d is 2698, it follows that its occurrence outside the initials \u201cA.L.M.\u201d of 2:1 on one side, and the initial \u201cN\u201d of 68:1 on the other side, is 57, 19\u00d73. Tables 9 to 18 prove that the initial \u201cNuN\u201d must be spelled out to show two N\u2019s.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact # 22.  S (Saad) This initial prefixes three suras, 7, 19, and 38, and the total occurrence of the letter \u201cS\u201d (Saad) in these three suras is 152, 19\u00d78 (namely 97, 26 and 29 per Table 2). It is noteworthy that in 7:69, the word \u201cBastatan\u201d is written in some printings with a \u201cSaad,\u201d instead of \u201cSeen.\u201d This is an erroneous distortion that violates the Quran\u2019s code. By looking at the oldest available copy of the Quran, the Tashkent Copy, it was found that the word \u201cBastatan\u201d is correctly written with a \u201cSeen\u201d (see photocopy).\n\nMiracle 19 Fact # 23. Historical Note: The momentous discovery that \u201c19\u201d is the Quran\u2019s common denominator became a reality in January 1974, coinciding with Zul-Hijjah 1393 A.H. The Quran was revealed in 13 B.H. (Before Hijrah). This makes the number of years from the revelation of the Quran to the revelation of its miracle 1393 + 13 = 1406 = 19\u00d774. As noted above, the unveiling of the Miracle took place in January 1974. The correlation between 19\u00d774 lunar years and 1974 solar years could not escape notice. This is especially uncanny in view of the fact that \u201c19\u201d is mentioned in Sura 74.\n\nMiracle 19 Fact # 24. Miracle 19 Fact # 23. Y. S. (Ya Seen) These two letters prefix Sura 36. The letter \u201cY\u201d occurs in this sura 237 times, while the letter \u201cS\u201d (Seen) occurs 48 times. The total of both letters is 285, 19\u00d715. It is noteworthy that the letter \u201cY\u201d is written in the Quran in two forms; one is obvious and the other is subtle. The subtle form of the letter may be confusing to those who are not thoroughly familiar with the Arabic language. A good example is the word \u201cAraany which is mentioned twice in 12:36. The letter \u201cY\u201d is used twice in this word, the first \u201cY\u201d is subtle and the second is obvious. Sura 36 does not contain a single \u201cY\u201d of the subtle type. This is a remarkable phenomenon, and one that does not normally occur in a long sura like Sura 36.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;oh good religious spam&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God\u2019s Miracle of 19 in Quran&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The miracle of 19: The truth about God\u2019s Universal Message in Mathematics \u2013 our soul\u2019s Absolute Submission and Devotion to God.

The total count of this letter in the N-initialed sura is 133, 19\u00d77. The fact that \u201cN\u201d is the last Quranic Initial (see Table 1) brings out a number of special observations. For example, the number of verses from the first Quranic Initial (A.L.M. of 2:1) to the last initial (N. of 68:1) is 5263, or 19\u00d7277. The word \u201cGod\u201d (Allah) occurs 2641 (19\u00d7139) times between the first initial and the last initial. Since the total occurrence of the word \u201cGod\u201d is 2698, it follows that its occurrence outside the initials \u201cA.L.M.\u201d of 2:1 on one side, and the initial \u201cN\u201d of 68:1 on the other side, is 57, 19\u00d73. Tables 9 to 18 prove that the initial \u201cNuN\u201d must be spelled out to show two N\u2019s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miracle 19 Fact # 22.  S (Saad) This initial prefixes three suras, 7, 19, and 38, and the total occurrence of the letter \u201cS\u201d (Saad) in these three suras is 152, 19\u00d78 (namely 97, 26 and 29 per Table 2). It is noteworthy that in 7:69, the word \u201cBastatan\u201d is written in some printings with a \u201cSaad,\u201d instead of \u201cSeen.\u201d This is an erroneous distortion that violates the Quran\u2019s code. By looking at the oldest available copy of the Quran, the Tashkent Copy, it was found that the word \u201cBastatan\u201d is correctly written with a \u201cSeen\u201d (see photocopy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miracle 19 Fact # 23. Historical Note: The momentous discovery that \u201c19\u201d is the Quran\u2019s common denominator became a reality in January 1974, coinciding with Zul-Hijjah 1393 A.H. The Quran was revealed in 13 B.H. (Before Hijrah). This makes the number of years from the revelation of the Quran to the revelation of its miracle 1393 + 13 = 1406 = 19\u00d774. As noted above, the unveiling of the Miracle took place in January 1974. The correlation between 19\u00d774 lunar years and 1974 solar years could not escape notice. This is especially uncanny in view of the fact that \u201c19\u201d is mentioned in Sura 74.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miracle 19 Fact # 24. Miracle 19 Fact # 23. Y. S. (Ya Seen) These two letters prefix Sura 36. The letter \u201cY\u201d occurs in this sura 237 times, while the letter \u201cS\u201d (Seen) occurs 48 times. The total of both letters is 285, 19\u00d715. It is noteworthy that the letter \u201cY\u201d is written in the Quran in two forms; one is obvious and the other is subtle. The subtle form of the letter may be confusing to those who are not thoroughly familiar with the Arabic language. A good example is the word \u201cAraany which is mentioned twice in 12:36. The letter \u201cY\u201d is used twice in this word, the first \u201cY\u201d is subtle and the second is obvious. Sura 36 does not contain a single \u201cY\u201d of the subtle type. This is a remarkable phenomenon, and one that does not normally occur in a long sura like Sura 36.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/79mnjx/jesus_warning_about_siege_on_jerusalem/dp38icc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dp38icc", "created": 1509392732.0, "author_flair_text": "revitalize the rapier industry", "created_utc": 1509363932.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
