It makes *everyone* productive.  You don't have ADHD because amphetamines make you concentrate and work hard - it makes everyone concentrate and work hard.  It turns everyone into a workhorse, and seemingly \"improves\" everyone's life.   \n\nUntil your dopamine and serotonin receptors are so downregulated from compensating from years of forced chemical machnation, you're always tired but never tired, you're dimwitted without the drug and haven't had to train your discipline with an ounce of self-mediated cognition.  Until it's 9 PM and the drugs have worn off, and you're dealing with the rebound effects that have made you angry again, for no reason, for another night.  Everyone needs to try adderall to understand how fleeting and vacuous inspiration and motivation is when it does not precede the human spark that served as momentum before pharmaceuticals.\n\nA common theme with kids who have a childhood colored in the bright neon saturday-morning-cartoon palette of amphetamine is that they adopt a curiosity about self-regulation in the context of an experience of negativity and doubt.  They have been told that they can't regulate the self, and the meditative awareness to go beyond impulse, what the stoics and eastern contemplatives understood as a universal human problem, becomes on the forefront of their mind.  The problem of whether or not one can trust themselves to do what one wants to do never goes away for these people (ADHD kids) - it must be confronted.    It is rare to find an adult who was soaked in amphetamine existence as a child not come to this intense curiousity about their inner experience and their ability to self-regulate themself.  It is uncomfortable to be cast in that doubt about one's ability to change their life without a pharmaceutical company blessing you wit hthe dopaminergic communion wafer.\n\nMeditate.  Sit with yourself and avail yourself of the discomfort.  Become interested in why you become disinterested.  There is something there to be seen that is passed over everytime you take a pill.  They have taught you to believe that you need something to make you concentrate, but what they have given you has made you bypass the one thing you need to concentrate on - the filaments of doubt that keep you psychologically and chemically dependent on a drug to do what civilization has been moved to do since the birth of mankind.  Why do I have no momentum when I need to work?  Why does my mind wander?  Why does my will fail and my mind fail to make ends meet?\n\nThe progenitors of European civilization did not construct a chapel by dint of dopamine, they \"felt\" the spirit in the blocks and the paint.  There is something inert about art and science that has been created solely after the dopamine has been applied.  For reference, see what has been constructed when the spirit, thought, meaning, and wisdom preceded the dopamine.  There is a difference between who you are and what you do on adderall and who you are and what you do not on adderall - it is not simply a matter of lacking motivation because the lacking of motivation is endemic to who you are.  If you do not explore that now, you will have to explore it later - as all ADHD kids will learn as adults.  It never goes away.   There is something distinct within that distraction that can't be made knowable through a pill.  What can't be made knowable through pharmaceutical injunction is made knowable through a move from the inner self - and that version of the self can't be given amphetamines.  That version of the self is what creates beautiful architecture from math.  That self is civilization.  \n\nThat difference is extremely visible; it's a stark contrast that appears to the adults that drank Ritalin as kids.\n\nI know from experience.", "edited": 1477499759.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhd medication isn&amp;#39;t useless for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;.

Until it&amp;#39;s 9 PM and the drugs have worn off, and you&amp;#39;re dealing with the rebound effects that have made you angry again, for no reason, for another night.  Everyone needs to try adderall to understand how fleeting and vacuous inspiration and motivation is when it does not precede the human spark that served as momentum before pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common theme with kids who have a childhood colored in the bright neon saturday-morning-cartoon palette of amphetamine is that they adopt a curiosity about self-regulation in the context of an experience of negativity and doubt.  They have been told that they can&amp;#39;t regulate the self, and the meditative awareness to go beyond impulse, what the stoics and eastern contemplatives understood as a universal human problem, becomes on the forefront of their mind.  The problem of whether or not one can trust themselves to do what one wants to do never goes away for these people (ADHD kids) - it must be confronted.    It is rare to find an adult who was soaked in amphetamine existence as a child not come to this intense curiousity about their inner experience and their ability to self-regulate themself.  It is uncomfortable to be cast in that doubt about one&amp;#39;s ability to change their life without a pharmaceutical company blessing you wit hthe dopaminergic communion wafer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditate.  Sit with yourself and avail yourself of the discomfort.  Become interested in why you become disinterested.  There is something there to be seen that is passed over everytime you take a pill.  They have taught you to believe that you need something to make you concentrate, but what they have given you has made you bypass the one thing you need to concentrate on - the filaments of doubt that keep you psychologically and chemically dependent on a drug to do what civilization has been moved to do since the birth of mankind.  Why do I have no momentum when I need to work?  Why does my mind wander?  Why does my will fail and my mind fail to make ends meet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The progenitors of European civilization did not construct a chapel by dint of dopamine, they &amp;quot;felt&amp;quot; the spirit in the blocks and the paint.  There is something inert about art and science that has been created solely after the dopamine has been applied.  For reference, see what has been constructed when the spirit, thought, meaning, and wisdom preceded the dopamine.  There is a difference between who you are and what you do on adderall and who you are and what you do not on adderall - it is not simply a matter of lacking motivation because the lacking of motivation is endemic to who you are.  If you do not explore that now, you will have to explore it later - as all ADHD kids will learn as adults.  It never goes away.   There is something distinct within that distraction that can&amp;#39;t be made knowable through a pill.  What can&amp;#39;t be made knowable through pharmaceutical injunction is made knowable through a move from the inner self - and that version of the self can&amp;#39;t be given amphetamines.  That version of the self is what creates beautiful architecture from math.  That self is civilization.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That difference is extremely visible; it&amp;#39;s a stark contrast that appears to the adults that drank Ritalin as kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know from experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/59glqi/ex_addadhd_kids_when_did_you_stop_taking_your/d98i3vs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_d98i3vs", "created": 1477520561.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1477491761.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d98bd6j", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Suicidal_2003", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 28, "parent_id": "t3_59glqi", "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Never got doped.
