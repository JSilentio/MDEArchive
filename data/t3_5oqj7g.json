Can anyone hear this? I\u2019ve lost all feeling, but somehow I still know that I am feeling. I feel a repetitive dreadful vibe every time I step outside of this motel room. Maybe I should continue to exist here and make it my existential domain. I have everything I could ever need. I am a god to my people. I show mercy where it is fit and fury where it is necessary.
