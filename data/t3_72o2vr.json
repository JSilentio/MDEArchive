It&amp;#39;s a bit childish to &amp;quot;troll leftists online&amp;quot; but I find it funny and its not all I do. Most nights when I&amp;#39;m not schooling or studying i&amp;#39;m hanging out with friends or my girlfriend, so I&amp;#39;m not a complete loser like I made myself out to be in my last post, I&amp;#39;d just rather have something concrete, a salary that I can rely on, and then maybe start a family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just doesn&amp;#39;t feel like college is taking me anywhere, like I&amp;#39;m in this perpetual cycle of barely holding on to my sanity, I nearly have my associates and would be switching to a 4 year for engineering, but it just seems so far away and un-obtainable. Sitting through these ridiculous electives like speech, art appreciation, and humanities etc.. Just feels like a waste of time and money.. It feels like I&amp;#39;m being duped hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;ve wasted my life up until now, idk. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "milliondollarextreme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/72o2vr/hell_survival_post/dnlqlhy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dnlqlhy", "created": 1506583907.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1506555107.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/milliondollarextreme", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dnlpzzf", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PunchingArianaGrande", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dnlpelq", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Yeah I know one of my old friends just wasn't able for the college lifestyle, it's understandable.
